According to Rikako's research, the stone might be a key to a long-forgotten portal, used by Reimu's predecessors. If Reimu used this portal to get to her new home, then we might use this portal to reach her quickly. But this is a high-risk project, we must get fully prepared for any possible result. And also be prepared to face Reimu's army even if we succeeded in all other aspects."

And they have been sensitive to foreign invasions, so subjugated many of their neighbors.\n\nIf this account is true, sending our forces into China to search for the elusive Chang'e is very likely to provoke them. Fortunately, Lunarian's records indicate that the current Chinese dynasty is not in control of their northern border well. Especially as the tribes to the northeast of China are unable to band together as a single force and are under the loose control of the Chinese dynasty.

It is possible that Chang'e is disguising herself as a goddess to the humans and using their faith to gather strength to escape from us forever.
