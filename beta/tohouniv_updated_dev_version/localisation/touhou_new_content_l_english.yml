Zeus was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods on Olympus.\n\n With our Weather Control abilities, and Celestial heritage, Tenshi and Iku can easily pretend to be Zeus relatives, gaining the trust of Greeks as their new goddesses.\n\nBy showing the Greeks our real power against Ottomans, we forced them to rebel against their opressors, claiming their loyalty to us, as their new gods."

They promise us to get rid of the invaders, and restore the moon to the former glory. But in return, they ask us to become their Junior partner of Union. Although this proposal sounds outrageous, we might have to agree to it, in order to save our country. "

 flavor_hvr.9.t: "Yorihime Teaches Tenshi and Iku!"
 flavor_hvr.9.desc: "With our help, Lunarians regain full control over the moon. Even though they are now our subjects, they are still somewhat grateful for us. With that in mind, Tenshi asked Yorihime to teach Iku how to use Weather Control abilities in a better way.\n\nYorihime, being the master of controlling gods, agreed to teach Iku how to control and use power of Dragon God in our advantage. With that, Iku will be able to use new abilities and smite her enemies with her new acquired powers!"

With her new knowledge acquired from Suwako, Tenshi now knows how to manipulate earth, making it softer or harder depending on what situation needs. Not only that, now, Tenshi knows how to change the flows of the rivers, and to use to our advantage.\n\nBut there is one more thing that Tenshi learned from Suwako, quite simple and effective way to use earth as a weapon. Mixing rocks with hardened earth, to create an artificial meteorite!"

 flavor_hvr.12.desc: "With time, Tenshi and Iku grew more accustomed to controlling weather, even in inconvenient ways. Not only that, but their power grew too!\n\nFrom now, Iku can create Hurricane to wreck havoc on enemy cities. Tenshi, on the other hand, learned how to create Rainbow.

 flavor_hvr.14.desc: "An eccentric celestial, Tenshi, has come to us with a rather strange proposal. She offers us her protection in exchange for our technology. She seems to be most interested in our cannon technology.\n\nIs is up to us how to deal with this offer. We can receive her protection, but we will lose our independence, so that might be a bad choice. Or, we can offer to sell our cannon technologies for a hefty price, while maintaining friendly relations with Tenshi, but, we are not sure if she will accept this counter-offer. Lastly, we can just ignore her offer completely, but that might make Tenshi angry with us."

 flavor_hvr.19.t: "Dualism of Slavic Gods"
 flavor_hvr.19.desc: "In old Slavic culture, the gods and spirits were polarized, representing opposites, such as darkness and light, masculine and feminine.\n\nFor Slavic people, the highest god of the pantheon was Perun, the god of sky, thunder, lightning, storms, rain, law, war, fertility and oak trees. With Iku abilities to control thunder, lightning, storm and rain, it will be quite easy to represent her as the descendant of the Perun, gaining the trust of the Slavic people, and converting them to the old faith!\n\nMat Zemlya, meaning Mother Earth, was being the oldest deity in old Slavic religion, and one of the most important one too. The earth, according to the common Slavic tradition, is a symbol of motherhood and femininity. She is the universal Mother and nurse: she nourishes the living, and accepts the dead. With Tenshi ability to control and manipulate Earth, she is more than ready to prove herself to be a Mother Earth for the Slavic people, returning their faith to the old ways. Even before becoming a celestial, Tenshi first name was Chiko, which means Earth Child. Who knows, perhaps Tenshi was always connected to Mother Earth, being her descendant.\n\nIn riddles and old sayings, archaic ideas about sky (Perun) and earth (Mother Earth) as a married couple have been preserved. With both Iku representing Perun, and Tenshi representing Mother Earth, we will surely gain trust of Slavic people!"

 flavor_hvr.20.desc: "With the fall of Rome, and arrival of that mysterious girl that claim herself to be a Angel and Goddess at the same time, Christians really started to doubt their own faith. The rumors says, that the Judgement day is here, and the only way to find the salvation - is to accept Tenshi as our saviour. Some, on other hand, believe that Angel, Tenshi, is here not to save us, but to proclaim the beginning of the end of the world!\n\nEither way we can certainly use that against them! Let them think that the Judgement day is upon them, and that only Tenshi can save them! So, abandom your old faith, and accept Tenshi as your sole Saviour in the apocalypce ahead! And for those that still doubt Tenshi... there is a few meteorites that can accidently fall into your country!"

Now, Byakuren herself has been forced to accept Taoism as her main religion!\n\nFor these deeds, Miko is very grateful to us, and Tenshi in particular. As such, Miko blesses Tenshi to rule the Heavenly Realms, which will increase Tenshi's authority among the religious class of our country."
 flavor_hvr.21.a: "Good."
 flavor_hvr.22.t: "A Nice Beating for Yukari"
 flavor_hvr.22.desc: "There has always been a rather strained relationship between Tenshi and Yukari. Well, from now on, these differences have been resolved! Tenshi gave Yukari a good beating that Yukari would not forget for a long time. Perhaps Yukari will have to rest... for 20 or 30 years.\n\nNot only that, Tenshi, and our country in particular, has received a lot of prestige for beating up one of the strongest beings of Gensokyo, sage Yukari Yakumo herself. Perhaps, other countries will even turn a blind eye if we conquer their neighbors."

 flavor_hvr.23.t: "Old Norse"
 flavor_hvr.23.desc: "According to the ancient belief of the peoples of Scandinavia, people are filled with a divine essence that is outside of consciousness. This divine essence is expressed through gods and goddesses. The gods are relatives of people, it is customary to honor and praise the gods. The most notable god in the old Norse religion was the supreme god of the pantheon, who is revered the most, Odin. Thor, son of Odin, is the lord of storms and the guardian of the world of people, was also very famous and respected. Other gods such as Freyja, Loki, Yggdrasil, Tyr, Njord were also fairly known and respected.\n\nThe interesting fact about the Norse gods, is that they were eating miraculous rejuvenating apples, that allowed them to remain immortal and gave them strength. It almost sounds like our Heavenly Peaches - a special kind of peaches growing in heaven, which allows anyone eating them, to increase their strenght.\n\nWith excellent ability to control storms, hurricanes, and lightning, Iku can pass herself off as Odin's daughter quite easily. With abilities quite similar to Thor, son of Odin, she will claim herself to a daughter of Odin, which will help in submitting Scandivian people to us, and our faith.\n\nWith a great ability to destroy everything in her path, with her warlike spirit and hot temper, Tenshi can easily impersonate Brunhilde, the great Valkyrie, to lead the Scandinavian people into a war against our enemies!"

By seizing these lands for ourselves, we will be able to increase our influence in the world, and in Gensokyo in particular.\n\nThe region, called Cascadia is nothing of interest. The climate here is harsh, but controlling these lands will allow us to create a transit point with Gensokyo, allowing us to more comfortably travel between Heavens, Gensokyo, and America.\n\nNow, in order to create settlements in Cascadia, we will need people and money. The more we invest in our expedition, the faster we will create a colony."

It is warm here, the sun shines on these lands quite often, and the ocean breeze adds coolness, making the weather most pleasant. Around us - the ocean, mountains, fields. This place definitely has an eye-catching beauty.\n\nBut that's not all. The Aboriginal tribes that inhabited the area of California told us about the rumors that California is rich in minerals, such as gold, silver, and iron. Let's test this rumor by examining the mountains and mines of California. Perhaps we can find something."

That doesn't seems to be a proper way if we want to establish complete domination over America. So, we should create a whole new country instead!\n\nFrom now on, Heavenly States of America will be created! This new country will be under our direct control, and will unite all of the scattered small colonies into one, strong country! The population of this country will consist of already established settlers, as well as bored Celestials that will want to try out something new, on the new continent."

They will provide us with best troops and ships that they can offer, concentrating only on army, ignoring the trade completely.\n\nOr, we can make Heavenly States completely concentrate on trade instead. This will allow us to transfer trade power from them, and receive large economical benefits."

This decision will provide you with dynamic reward, providing you with merchants and global trade power. The amount of merchants and global trade power will depend on total development of Heavenly States of America. The more development they have, the more powerful reward you will receive.\n\n"

It takes time, supplies, and our traders don't even want to make such a long trip on the lands without proper roads.\n\nWe shall fix this immidiently, by starting a grand construction throught the whole America! We will build  a modern road that will connect most of our American states. This road will allow our troops to travel through whole America without issues, filled to the brim with supplies. Our traders will also enjoy a modern, protected road.\n\nFor some reason, Tenshi wants to call this grand road as... Route 66."

And now it is Tenshi responsobility to deal with them. We can deal with them in several ways.\n\nThe first way would finding a loophole in the contract, in the agreement that Tenshi made with the Oni. It might take some of our time, and our best minds will have to work on the solution. Then, we will also have to persuade them to leave our lands peacefully. Perhaps we will need to pay them with gold.\n\nThe second solution would be to just expel them with force. While Oni are really strong, so are we, Celestials. We might take some losses, but we will expel them for sure!\n\nAnd the third option, would be to offer a job for Oni. Oni is strong, and we could really use their forces as mercenaries. It will take some time to create a proper offer for Oni, that they will surely accept, and it will also require us to pay up a hefty sum of ducats to them in advance."

And who are you even?\n\nWithout wasting a single moment, the person with scythe attacked.\n\n-You overstayed your time in this world.

Every time, Celestials have to fight for their lifes, as Shinigamis really have the power to take it away quite easily. Even though most skirmishes end in victory for the Celestials, it still gets on our nerves, and now, even Tenshi felt it herself.\n\nSo let's solve this problem once and for all. Shinigamis that are being sent to Heaven, do not act of their own free will. No, they have a boss that makes them do it - Yama, the judge of the dead. Most likely, Eiki Shiki is behind these Shinigamis that continue to invade the Heavens, trying to take the lives of our Celestials, so it would be logical to deal with this Yama.\n\nWe can choose a different approaches in solving this problem. We can punch this Eiki in the face in such a way that it will discourage her from trying to poke her nose into Heaven ever again. Or... we can pay her a friendly, diplomatic visit and offer her a bribe, in return to finally stopping sending her Shinigamis to Heaven."

But despite this, after some time, we got down to business.\n\nArguing that we, the Celestials, are in fact one of the nicest persons in Gensokyo, that we do not interfere with anyone, we began to persuade Yama to stop sending Shinigamis after Celestials in the Heavens. And in order to finally convince Yama in the rightness of our words, we gave her a small, modest gift. 1000 ducats for Yama Eiki Shiki so she can take a break from her tiresome work!\n\nAfter we gave Yama a small gift, her attitude towards us immediately changed. She agreed that the Celestials were generally good people. After all, only good people can have so much gold. On this, we decided and agreed with Yama that she would not send Shinigami to heaven."

Of course, Aya will pays us some money in return, if we will give her a good material for article!

Eiki Shiki, using her official position, decided the fate of many people in a positive way, without sending them to Hell if they provided her with a hefty sum of money! It seems that money rule even over hell. One of the witnesses, Celestial, Tenshi Hinanawi confirmed our information! Tenshi personally gave a bribe to the judge, and she gladly accepted it!\n\nWhat is this Eiki Shiki doing with all this money she gets from bribes? We had to do a thorough investigation to find out, and we found what we were looking for! The luxurious mansion on the shores of Gulf of Gensokyo belongs to our dear judge! Golden decoration of the premises, a separate bar, a lounge, a ballroom, and much, much more were found in this mansion. After discovering the building plan, we also noticed a certain Mud Warehouse in the mansion.

We can help them deal with Junko, but in return, they will be forced to become our Junior partners. They might disagree with that offer, but we can always try.

By building new architecture and restoring what has been damaged by the war, we expect to gain even more trust from the Lunarian princess. Yorihime Watatsuki, with her abilities to control and summon various gods, can become a valuable teacher for Iku.

We need to fix this gap between Tenshi and Iku, as Iku's help will be very useful for both the country and Tenshi.\n\nBy building a personal office for Iku, with a break room, Tenshi will show Iku that she appreciates her.
