 ###INCIDENTS GENERAL EVENTS###
 th_danmaku_event.1.t: "Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.1.desc: "Because this is your first Incident, I will explain how it works: Incidents are a chain of events, which impact large areas of Gensokyo, your realm and the characters, which are involved in this mess - your ruler is among them. \nDuring the Incident your ruler will make a journey through Gensokyo and encounter special foes: the Stage Bosses from the original Touhou games. To progress the Incident storyline you'll have to find a way to pass these Bosses. The most common way for this is the traditional \"Danmaku Fight\" between your ruler and your opponent. The combat skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - Military Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Army Tradition * 3\n - Religious Unity * 0.5\n - Tolerance of the True Faith * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your fighting skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win. Victories increase \"points\" for a positive ending of the Incident, while defeats decrease them. The decisions you make in random Incident events affect these points too. When all Stage Bosses are cleared you'll get an ending event and, if the score is high enough, gain a powerful modifier."

 th_danmaku_event.3.a: "Well then, one less enemy to worry about."
 th_danmaku_event.3.tt: "This victory gave you a bonus for a positive ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.4.t: "Draw"
 th_danmaku_event.4.desc: "The fight was long, hard and sweaty. Neither you nor your opponent could defeat the other. After hours of fighting and shooting danmaku at each other, your opponent acknowledged your strength and let you pass."
 th_danmaku_event.4.a: "I didn't lose. I just decided not to win."
 th_danmaku_event.4.tt: "This draw gave you a minor bonus for a positive ending of the current Incident."
 th_danmaku_event.5.t: "Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.5.desc: "The fight was long and hard. Regardless of how many danmaku you shot, how often you hit your opponent - you just couldn't defeat them. You retreat from the fight wounded and defeated, but not broken."

 th_danmaku_event.6.tt: "This major defeat gave you a bonus for a negative ending of the current Incident." 
 th_danmaku_event.7.t: "A little reminder"
 th_danmaku_event.7.desc: "Ok, Apparently I'll have to explain to you the system again: Incidents are a chain of events, which impact large areas of Gensokyo, your realm and the characters, which are involved in this mess - your ruler is among them. \nDuring the Incident your ruler will make a journey through Gensokyo and encounter special foes: the Stage Bosses from the original Touhou games.

 th_incidents_event.11.desc: "The effects of the current incident mark the entire land and it is unclear how long it will take until this incident gets solved. One day you come along to a \"Wanted Sign\", but instead of a criminal it is an investigator wanted! It appears that the former investigator may have been killed and the people of Gensokyo don't know who should continue the investigations. Maybe you, [Root.Monarch.GetName], can grab this chance to earn the glory of somebody, who saved Gensokyo from the Incident..."
 th_incidents_event.11.a: "I have my own reasons why I want this incident done. I will be the new investigator!"
 th_incidents_event.11.a.tt: "Your ruler becomes the new investigator and continues to fight the current incident!"
 th_incidents_event.11.b: "I am sorry, but I don't have the time to solve this incident."
 th_incidents_event.11.b.tt: "Your ruler ignores the sign shield and somebody else becomes the investigator.\nNote: you won't get any other chance to become an investigator for the current incident."

 th_danmaku_event.20.t: "Diplomatically Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.20.desc: "Sometimes two friends are arguing with each other or want to do a Danmaku Fight without the threat of anybody getting killed. In those cases the \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\", also known as a \"Friendly Danmaku Fight\" or short \"DDF\" or rather \"FDF\", will be used instead of the traditional Danmaku Fight. The \"combat\" skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - +50 points, because a ruler without SOME diplomatic skills is not a ruler\n - Diplomatic Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Prestige * 3\n - The Number of Subjects * 50\n - Diplomatic Reputation * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your diplomatic skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win. Contrary to the known, normal fights, the DDF cannot cause a death to your participating ruler. However, it is still a Danmaku Fight and as such it can cause heavy environmental damage and the loser must pay the winner and the repair costs.\nDDFs usually don't appear in incidents and are quite unique."
 th_danmaku_event.20.a: "Thanks for the information."
 th_danmaku_event.21.t: "Major Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.21.desc: "It was a short argument and you easily convinced your opponent for your case without the need to shoot any danmaku missiles, which means you get not only the normal winner prize but also the money for the usual repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.21.a: "And they say Charisma isn't worth skilling."
 th_danmaku_event.22.t: "Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.22.desc: "Your arguments were solid and your missiles hit the mark perfectly. It didn't take long before your opponent capitulated before your diplomatic (and fighting) skills."
 th_danmaku_event.22.a: "Speak soft words and big sticks can bring one far."
 th_danmaku_event.23.t: "Draw"
 th_danmaku_event.23.desc: "A long and grindy argument was going on, but neither one could convince the other one with either the arguments or the missiles. In the end you and your opponent settled for a draw. Luckily your opponent has a little too much money and decided to take over the repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.23.a: "Well, at least I didn't lose money."
 th_danmaku_event.24.t: "Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.24.desc: "You tried to convince your opponent, but all of your arguments were baseless and your opponent made a good point. In the end you decided to let the argument be before some missiles fly so you have only to pay your penalty."
 th_danmaku_event.24.a: "My opponent made some good points though."
 th_danmaku_event.25.t: "Major Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.25.desc: "Your opponents arguments weren't not only better but also at provoking.

It is clear that this argument didn't go your way - and on top of that you have now to pay those massive repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.25.a: "Oh come on! An argument with taunting is not fair!"
 th_danmaku_event.26.t: "A little reminder about DDFs"
 th_danmaku_event.26.desc: "It seems you need a little reminder how a Diplomatic Danmaku Fight works. Well, don't worry. They are so rare it is quite normal to forget how they work.\nNow then: The \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\", also known as a \"Friendly Danmaku Fight\" or short \"DDF\" or rather \"FDF\", will be used instead of the traditional Danmaku Fight.

Because of her sun sensitive skin she has to remain in the great halls of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. But one day she decided that her freedom of movement was limited for too long and she released the Scarlet Mist, a magical red fog, which blocks any sunlight. And even though Remilia will attract many adventurers and self-proclaimed investigators, who seek to stop her, she enjoys every single second of this incident. The eternal, scarlet night is a beautiful sight after all..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.400.desc.2: "During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land. It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. The inhabitants of Gensokyo are worried, that the sun might be gone forever and now they are seeking the help of the shrine maiden to end the spreading of this unnatural fog..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.400.a: "I should investigate the source of this mist and bring the good weather back."

As you follow this pattern you see in the distance a complete black sphere flying aimlessly - and it just bumps into a tree.\nYou are approaching the crash spot and find a dizzy girl. This girl is Rumia, the youkai of darkness. Rumia doesn't want you to continue your search until she is fed - and she wants to eat you! She doesn't seem that big of a threat though and could just be ignored because of her dizziness, but with her around, there's not enough light to find the way to the lake, so you might as well put an end to her nighttime snack craving."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.a: "She's in my way! I'll have to fight her, if I want to find the source of the mist."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Rumia and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!\nThe chances for a victory depend on your §YRuler's Military Skill§!, your §YArmy Tradition§!, your §YReligious Unity§! and your §YTolerance of the True Faith§!. §YDanmaku Power§! increases your ruler's power by a fixed amount and §YDanmaku Power Modifier + 100%§! increases your chances prozentually.\n\nBe cautious though: even the most powerful warriors can lose the easiest fights!

 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.c: "My allies can deal with her."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.c.tt: "You will send Rumia to one of your allies to deal with her. While it gives you a minor bonus for a positive ending, your allies won't be too happy with Rumia and you. If you get unlucky this may even backfire..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.d: "She's just a nuisance and will go eventually."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.d.tt: "You will try to ignore her presence. She won't harm you, yet she will annoy you and slows your progress down, resulting in a minor malus for a positive ending of the Incident."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.t: "Cirno, Ice Fairy of the Lake"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.desc: "After you passed Rumia, you finally managed to reach the Misty Lake. A magical fog completely covers the lake and you have trouble to see through it. Hours have passed on the lake and you become unsure where you are. Suddenly you hear a voice: \"When you lose your way, it's because of the fairies!\"\nYou see two fairies approaching you - a green haired one and a smaller, blue haired one. While the greenhead doesn't seem to want to bother you, the bluehead actively tries to block you on your path.\nHer name is Cirno, \"the Strongest\", and wants you to show who's the boss of this lake. You'll never find the culprit with this obstruction around, so why not brave a hailstorm or two? Her specialty is ice and freezing magic, so she's someone who'd be pretty useful on a hot summer day."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.a: "Well, if she's responsible for this fog, I'll have to blow her and her fog away!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Cirno and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.b: "I don't have time for this! Annoy someone else!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.b.tt: "You skip the fight and send Cirno in a random direction away from you - with the promise to freeze fun stuff. While it allows you to make progress, you sent her (unfortunately) to your realm, where she creates chaos and results in decreasing your progress. At the end, you will gain a minor bonus for a positive ending (and a lot of frozen frogs in your realm)."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.c: "Cirno... just go back to your realm."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.c.tt: "You send Cirno back to her realm and as your vassal she obeys. Even though she isn't too happy about the fact that she isn't the boss of the lake anymore."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d: "Ok, listen up you little fairy..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d.tt: "You try to trick Cirno into dissolving the fog she created..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d.success: "... and your trick works."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d.fail: "... and your trick fails, because she is too stupid to fall for it."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.e: "I will shake Cirno off in the fog."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.e.tt: "You try to flee from the annoyance and get stuck even more in the fog. While she won't bother you anymore, you will lose time in the fog. But at least you have time to rethink your ruling strategies..."

 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.desc: "As the fog faded and the path became clear, you eventually reached the center of this Scarlet Mist: a large mansion in the middle on a little island. As you were looking how to enter a house of the scale of a town you encounter a young woman with long red hair in front of a gate. She reveals herself to be the gatekeeper Hong Meiling and the outer door guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and does her job with flair. A youkai wielding rainbow magic and an interesting dash, she stands between you and the center of the mist. But while she takes her job seriously, she also takes a break after some hours."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.a: "Well, this Incident can't wait any further. I'll probably have to punch my way through."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Meiling and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.d: "At the wish of the Celestial Emperor, I demand you to let me pass!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.d.tt: "Meiling is skeptical about your demand, but you show her your Celestial Seal. She has never seen nor heard of a Celestial Seal, but she recognizes the symbols on the seal and lets you through nonetheless."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.e: "I could sneak past her when she's doing her break again."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.e.tt: "You skip the fight and wait for Meiling to take a break. Hours and hours are passing, but finally Meiling takes a nap and you can pass her. But the time you've been waiting and observing her wasn't very productive."

 th_incidents_scarletmists.5.desc: "After you've passed the gatekeeper, you stumble into a large library. A very good friend you know would fall in love with this place immediately and take all these books. While you grin about the image of said friend with a tower of books in arms, you encounter a devil girl and, while she didn't pose a threat, she did make a lot of noise in your fight with her.\nA few moments later a voice echoes through the library: \"You, the red-white one! There is no rampaging around in my study.\" A woman with long, purple hair and a outfit, which looks more like something you would wear in bed than in a library, approaches you. This woman, Patchouli Knowledge, is the librarian of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. As the guardian of the books in the library, she stops you as you try to find the cause of all this mist. She may be weak in body, but her magic is top-notch."

 th_incidents_scarletmists.5.b: "Perhaps I can pay my way through with books..."

As you begin to think you're lost in this mansion you notice some fairies flying around. They are dressed as maids and carry all kinds of cleaning tools. You even witness how two fairies, their sight completely blocked by their large brooms they carry, crash into each other. All of a sudden you hear an angered voice: \"Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere! The mistress will be angry with me!!\" An elegant looking maid with silver hair appears. She is the mysterious chief maid Sakuya Izayoi and looks like a normal human, but don't be fooled: with her astonishing ability to control time and her remarkable skill with knives, she truly is a dangerous opponent - and she won't let any intruder get to her mistress."

The figure rises from the throne and approaches you - and when the shadows around shrink you can see the true person: a young looking girl with light-blue hair, red eyes and large, black, bat-like wings on her back. She reveals herself as the master of the house and the vampire Remilia Scarlet. She is the cause of all the Scarlet Mist that has been hanging around Gensokyo. Although she appears young, she is in fact over 500 years of age, and claims to be a descendant of Tepes himself. While her origin may be a lie, her goal to spread the mist is not. It will take a tough fight to end her plans."

Arriving in the basement you see a little girl with short, blonde hair, red eyes and wings with colorful crystals. She reveals herself as Flandre Scarlet, Remilia's younger sister. Having lived alone in a basement for 495 years, the commotion of recent events drew her attention. Flandre is only 5 years younger than her sister, but possesses far greater power. All alone, deep underground, it's hard to say that this is a blessing rather than a curse. Regardless, she now wants to play danmaku with you and won't hold back."

Still, you don't want a powerful vampire walking in the shrine and try to convince her to leave. Then suddenly, you hear a loud, intimidating thunder - pretty unusual for this time of the year. As your guest and you look outside, you find a large, dark cloud over the shrine. As soon as Remilia leaves the building, the cloud starts raining. Because of the vampire's weakness to stay in flowing water like rain, Remilia is forced to stay a little bit longer in the shrine - to your discomfort.

You fly forwards until 3 girls get you in the way. It appears they are \"poltergeists\" from Europe - and they hunger for the meat of your servant.

Suddenly, the music stops and 3 girls appear directly in front of you! Those are the Prismriver Sisters, 3 ghosts - or better known as \"poltergeists\" - who \"live\" in this mansion.

While the chaos is ongoing her next step is to increase the power of hell raven, which eventually should be the energy source for this modernization attempt.\n\nLittle did Kanako know that with these actions she set a chain of event in motions, which will change Gensokyo forever..."

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.19.desc: "The servants of the Moriya province are not happy with our rule and demand now that we cede their land back to its former owner! If we refuse, they will revolt with all their men!"

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.19.b: "Fiine..."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.20.t: "The Moriya Shrine demands independence!"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.20.desc: "Ever since the Shrine started spreading their faith to all of Gensokyo, our Moriya vassal has become quite rebellious. However, the worst of their behaviour wasn't reached yet: the Moriya deities refused to send any troops for our case, sabotaged our efforts to keep religious unity in the realm and even started acting independent!"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.20.a: "They will lose this cocky attitude eventually."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.20.b: "They really are not worth the stress. Let them know that they are free now."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.21.t: "Increasing Popularity of Moriya Shintoism"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.21.desc: "Ever since Kanako and Sanae increased their conversion efforts as well made their intentions public, Moriya Shintoism found quite a lot of popularity among the humans of Gensokyo. However, not all of the new followers are free to pray to Kanako and live their new religion out. To solve this problem, Kanako worked out a 10 Point List, which should even convince the most stubborn rulers to convert to Moriya Shintoism."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.21.a: "Sometimes words are more effective than any danmaku."

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.22.t: "The Counter Reformation"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.22.desc: "Moriya Shintoism spreads like a plague over Gensokyo and many realms are wrestling for religious authority and unity. In these dire times many shrine maidens of Gensokyo have gathered in the Hakurei Shrine to discuss a solution to the heretic menace. Their result: the Counter Reformation!\nEvery realm, which seeks to end the issues caused by the heretic reformation may have the option to contact the shrine maidens of the counter reformation to purge these Moriya troublemakers."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.22.a: "Hopefully this reformation will finally find its end soon."

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.23.desc: "[Root.GetName] fell to the Moriya missionaries and is now a hotspot for the next conversion in our land! But there's a way to avoid an additional spread of this accursed heresy: if we send some inquisitors to [Root.GetName], we might be able to break the religious zeal there."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.23.a: "We can't afford it sadly."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.23.b: "Break this zeal!"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.26.t: "Mountain of Faith Incident - Moriya Victory!"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.26.desc: "Gensokyo was a religious mess: in the North old, forgotten people still held to their dying traditions, to North East heathens from the main land brought Buddhism and Taoism to this world and the rest of Gensokyo is deluded by a backward Shintoism. But this is all in the past now as our power has taken over Gensokyo by now!"

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.29.desc: "While the Moriya Shrine itself has a decent range to convert many provinces of Gensokyo, it is still only one shrine in a land of many. Because of this, the shrine maiden Sanae Kochiya visited our humble realm and bought the allowance to establish a second shrine in our realm to increase the glorious reformation's range."

However, for this goal she needs a good power source with decent intelligence. Of course the choice was easy for who shall get the gift of Nuclear Power: our fair ruler Utsuho Reiuji!\nHowever, accepting this gift also means to make it official that Moriya Shintoism is our divine religion."
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.30.a: "That's not even a price. I shall take the nuke power!"

 th_cursed_donation_box.1.desc: "While the Hakurei Shrine is the anchor point of Gensokyo, the keeper of the Hakurei Barrier and the border between the World of Fantasy and the Outworld, it has a long lasting curse. Despite any kind of efforts, the shrine just seems to never get any human visitors. And when humans visit they never donate, which is everything but common for Shinto shrines. It's even the opposite! The shrine seems even LOSE donations - as if the donation box itself is cursed!\nMany speculate that the curse is due to Reimu's lazy attitude of praising to the Hakurei deity and that the Hakurei God is not pleased at Reimu at all..."

And due to their strict training of the fine danmaku martial arts our army quality won't even suffer!"
 th_cursed_donation_box.3.a: "We owe these maidens."
 th_cursed_donation_box.5.t: "Donations start flowing again!"
 th_cursed_donation_box.5.desc: "With the sudden absence of Reimu Hakurei the box finally starts filling up again - despite no changes of the amount of visitors. It is like the Hakurei deity was mad about Reimu all the time ..."
 th_cursed_donation_box.5.a: "We still should placate the Hakurei God one day."
 th_cursed_donation_box.5.a.tt: "The Curse of the Donation Box may return when Reimu Hakurei returns to our realm as long the Hakurei Deity is not placated."

 th_cursed_donation_box.14.desc: "A storm happened recently and dealt significant damage to the shrine - and this while the shrine is already suffering the donation box curse! Usually the damage is easily repaired, but due to the financial crisis, it's a lot harder nowadays..."
 th_cursed_donation_box.14.a: "The Shrine still has to be in top form!"
 th_cursed_donation_box.14.b: "*Sigh* There's nothing we can do about it."
 th_cursed_donation_box.15.t: "Financial Reform"
 th_cursed_donation_box.15.desc: "Due to the curse, our realm sees many financial problems. Fortunately, Suika has an idea to solve this issue: print more money!\nAlternatively, we take the idea of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and invest money to save more in the future."

 th_cursed_donation_box.16.t: "War and Pillage"
 th_cursed_donation_box.16.desc: "It is said that there are no rules in love and war - especially when the common soldier is not sure if they will get their earnings when their realm is going through a financial crisis. Because of these circumstances many of our troops started looting and pillaging the provinces of our enemies and throw all of their disciplined manners out of the window for more gold.\nOn the flip side: because of their newly acquired behaviour we are now justified to pay them less and let them loose on the enemies civilians."
 th_cursed_donation_box.16.a: "Let them be. The more money we can save the better."

 th_cursed_donation_box.17.desc: "Reports of a very powerful but rageful and feral youkais reached the ears of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! This creature is way too powerful for the normal shrine maidens, but for [Root.Monarch.GetName] this might be a welcome challenge - and some additional much needed gold..."

 TH_lunarian_events.1.desc: "You find a dusty crate. You are not sure what this crate contains, but it sure looks like it has been around for a long time. As you open the crate in your chambers, you cannot believe what you have found: a bunch of maps back from the times when the Moon was under attack from the youkai of Earth! Those maps describe a landmass known as Gensokyo! With those maps and Lunarian spies you have a good understanding of what is going on in Gensokyo!"
 TH_lunarian_events.1.a: "Interesting."
 TH_lunarian_events.8.t: "Lunarian Threat"
 TH_lunarian_events.8.desc: "The Lunarian are a powerful species, who are masters in art, religion, magic and technology. Because of our superiority in every shape and form we won the war against the invading youkai hundreds of years ago. However, even after all these years, our names are marked in the memories of the Earthlings. Should we ever attack Gensokyo in the near future everyone will try to focus on us!"
 TH_lunarian_events.8.a: "And even so, our armies will crush them nonetheless!"
 TH_lunarian_events.9.t: "Lunarian Defense System"
 TH_lunarian_events.9.desc: "Around a thousand years ago, Yukari Yakumo and her youkai lackeys tried to invade the moon to steal magic and technology of the Moon and to slaughter the Lunarians. It was a brutal war, which took the lives of thousands of moon rabbit servants, but in the end, the Lunarians managed to drive Yukari back to Earth. The war has been over for a long time, but its effects on the Lunarian society are still noticeable to this day. The Lunarian army built a massive defensive system for the Moon for the case that any Gensokyan should ever invade the Moon. Those defenses are still intact and will crush any invading force, which is foolish enough to attack the Moon."
 TH_lunarian_events.9.a: "Ok."
 TH_lunarian_events.9.tt: "The Lunarians are well protected from all attacks until somebody builds an Anti-Lunarian weapon or the year is 1550."
 TH_lunarian_events.10.t: "Earthlings dare to attack us!"
 TH_lunarian_events.10.desc: "History repeats itself and the puny Earthlings are indeed waging war upon us! It is time to put the Lunarian defenses to good use and send those weaklings home packing!"
 TH_lunarian_events.10.a: "They will regret putting even one foot on the Moon!"
 TH_lunarian_events.11.t: "Lunar Defenses get deactivated"
 TH_lunarian_events.11.desc: "The war against the puny Earthlings is over. Regardless of the outcome, the defense systems of the Moon get deactivated now until they dare to attack again!"
 TH_lunarian_events.11.a: "Hopefully they learned their lesson now."
 TH_lunarian_events.12.t: "Lunar Defenses are outdated!"
 TH_lunarian_events.12.desc: "The Lunar Defense Systems protected the Moon from Earth threats for a long time. But with the years the Earthlings managed to catch up with technology and magic and created weapons and armors, which can nullify the Defense System!"
 TH_lunarian_events.12.a: "Not the best news..."
 TH_lunarian_events.12.tt: "The Moon is open for any invasion by the Earthlings!"
 ###HKR EVENTS###
 flavor_hkr.2.t: "The many supporters of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_hkr.2.desc: "Reimu made many friends over the years, most of them through solving the incidents. Of course these friends are ready to help Reimu in times of need, but sadly, Reimu's abilities to handle them all is limited - like right now. If she wants to take the full advantage of the support, she has to decide whose help she can keep."
 flavor_hkr.2.a: "Remilia, I let you go back to the mansion."
 flavor_hkr.2.b: "Yuyuko, Netherworld is calling for you again."
 flavor_hkr.2.c: "Kaguya, it was fun, but the Bamboo Forest needs you."
 flavor_hkr.2.d: "Sanae, just get out of my sight you fun heretic."
 flavor_hkr.3.a.tt:0 "Every [Root.Religion.GetName] nation who is not allied to [HVR.GetName] will have an increased opinion of §G100§! to us."
 flavor_hkr.4.t: "Suika returns!"
 flavor_hkr.4.desc: "A whole week has passed and Suika is yet again at the Hakurei Shrine: this time even with proof that she truly was in Hell (she shows Eiki's stamp on her hand) and Heaven (she holds a torn out piece of Tenshi's clothes) and now she wishes for the sake. Reimu gives her the sake reluctantly and after a while, Suika becomes completely drunk...\nThe next morning, more chaos can be found at the shrine. As an apology, Suika offers her service for the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 flavor_hkr.4.a: "Well, her powers could be quite useful at the front."
 flavor_hkr.4.a.tt: "Suika Ibuki will become a general for our realm, which can be recruited every 30 - 60 years."
 flavor_hkr.4.b: "She could teach the other shrine maidens of how to fight in melee combat."
 flavor_hkr.4.b.tt: "Suika will remain in the training fields and won't be a general in our service."
 flavor_hkr.5.t: "A horned Shrine Maiden"
 flavor_hkr.5.desc: "Suika has been a long resident of the Hakurei Shrine for quite some time. Due to this, she enjoys a high trust from Reimu.\nWhile Reimu is a competent shrine maiden, she knows that her days are limited due to being a mortal so she is considering declaring Suika to the official heir of [Root.GetName]..."
 flavor_hkr.5.a: "On the other hand, I think it's not a great idea."
 flavor_hkr.5.a.tt: "Suika will remain to be only a resident of the Hakurei Shrine."
 flavor_hkr.5.b: "You will make a great apprentice, Suika."
 flavor_hkr.5.c: "You know what, I am in an age for retirement anyway."
 flavor_hkr.6.t: "Suika the Oni Miko"
 flavor_hkr.6.desc: "The time has come! Reimu has decided to retire and let the new Oni Shrine Maiden - Suika Ibuki - become the next shrine maiden! These are exciting news as never before was the Hakurei Shrine lead by somebody other than a human!\n\nUnlike Reimu, Suika is an oni, who honors strength, loyalty and honesty. Because of this reason, the last thing an oni would do would be ignoring a Call to Arms or an invasion from the outworld!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a: "Long live Suika!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a.tt: "Suika will no longer help the army as a general or as a trainer.\n\n§TSuika Ibuki is a ruler of honesty. In case of refusing a Call to Arms, Suika will perform suboptimally as a ruler for some time.§!"
 flavor_hkr.7.t: "Wounded Oni Honor!"
 flavor_hkr.7.desc: "For an oni nothing is holier than strength and honesty - especially the latter, which brings Suika to a dilemma as she had to refuse a call to arms. Something, which no oni would allow themselves to ever do! Due to this Suika is suffering quite a heavy burden on her shoulders until enough time has passed for her to forget."
 flavor_hkr.7.a: "Dishonorable..."
 flavor_hkr.102.t: "Reimu and the Incidents"
 flavor_hkr.102.desc: "Reimu Hakurei is technically just a normal human girl - she might have some strange, magical powers and the job of shrine maiden, but she is still a normal girl. However, due to her importance in Gensokyo's history, the Hakurei deity decided to transfer some of its powers to Reimu to ensure that her life will be long enough to take care of the many incidents Gensokyo will see in the future."
 flavor_hkr.102.a: "I will do my best."
 flavor_hkr.102.a.tt: "§YReimu is Immortal until the final incident is solved§!."
 flavor_hkr.103.t: "Reimu retires"
 flavor_hkr.103.desc: "With the resolvement of the final incident, the powers, which were given by the Hakurei deity, faded away - and Reimu reached a considerably high age...\nHowever, Reimu will not die to age. Instead, she is planning to retire and call it a death so everyone in Gensokyo would let her alone."
 flavor_hkr.103.a: "I sure as hell deserve retirement."
 flavor_hkr.10.t: "Punishment of a Celestial"
 flavor_hkr.10.desc: "Celestials are, in general, peaceful people who enjoy a life without any worries in Heaven and tend to be quite humble. However, Tenshi is the big exception: she is regularly bored of Heaven and travels down to Gensokyo to cause chaos and destruction - just for her pure enjoyment.\nHowever, this finally found its end as Suika traveled to Heaven and had her fun with Tenshi. As a result of this many Gensokyans are more than happy that finally someone brought justice upon Tenshi."
 flavor_hkr.10.a: "I just hope Tenshi really saw this as a punishment..."
 flavor_hkr.10.a.tt: "Every Gensokyan Hakurei Shinto nation, who is not allied with [HVR.GetName], will have increased opinion of us of §G+100§!."
 flavor_hkr.11.t: "The Barrier Team"
 flavor_hkr.11.desc: "Yukari Yakumo and Reimu Hakurei were both the protagonists during the Eternal Night Incident for Gensokyo and helped resolving the Fake Moon Issue. Unlike Marisa and Reimu, Yukari and Reimu are however no friends. However, they respect each other and sometimes even see each other as family (the truthfulness of this is however debatable). As a result of this it was not a big problem for Yukari's people to be integrated into the society of [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_hkr.11.a: "Hopefully they don't cause chaos."
 flavor_hkr.12.t: "Sake gift of the Shrine Maidens"
 flavor_hkr.12.desc: "The clergy of our realm came today to Reimu and gave her the highest quality sake possible in Gensokyo as well as the secret of producing it as a thank-you-gift for resolving the estate conflict."
 flavor_hkr.12.a: "Very nice of them!"
 th_hkr_sake_production_tt: "This gift will most likely attract sake loving onis in the future..."
 flavor_hkr.13.t: "Lifting of a Curse"
 flavor_hkr.13.desc: "Nobody knows who it is nor how it looks like, but the Hakurei God is one of the strongest yet mysterious one of all of Gensokyo and its wrath is feared. Our realm was relatively lucky as the only curse was the Donation Box - and this curse finds finally today its end! The Hakurei God is finally approving Reimu and our realm and lifts the curse of us!"
 flavor_hkr.13.a: "Today is a great day!"
 hkr_appealed_hakurei_god_tt: "The Hakurei God is pleased with our realm!"
 flavor_hkr.14.t: "The Eternal Gift"
 flavor_hkr.14.desc: "The day has come! The many preparations are made, the Curse of the Donation Box has been broken, the Heresy of Gensokyo has been eliminated and our [Root.GovernmentName] enjoys a time of tranquility and peace! Due to this, the gift was not surprising, but still overwhelming: the Hakurei God gave a portion of its power to Reimu Hakurei and granted her immortality! However, the job of a shrine maiden is tiring and Reimu could deserve retirement - but in the end it's her decision."
 flavor_hkr.14.a: "Well, I don't give up this job that easily!"
 flavor_hkr.14.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] could use some of my new powers."
 flavor_hkr.14.c: "[Root.GetName] shall remain eternal!"
 flavor_hkr.14.d: "I deserve a peaceful retirement."
 flavor_hkr.15.t: "A Miko and a Samurai"
 flavor_hkr.15.desc: "Long before the Hakurei Reformation and the invention of the Danmaku Combat System, the Hakurei Shrine was originally in the northern part of Gensokyo. During this time a young female samurai called Meira challenged Reimu to an honorable duel. Reimu defeated her quite easily, but she developed certain ... feelings towards Meira and vice versa. However, due to the movement of the shrine and the Hakurei Reformation, the contact between those two broke up. Meira remained in the Old Hakurei Shrine to maintain the traditions while Reimu lives on in the South.\nBut now, that the Old Hakurei Shrine is reclaimed by Reimu, she and Meira had again contact - and with that the emotions might have been revived too..."
 flavor_hkr.15.a: "Well, I do kinda like her..."
 flavor_hkr.15.a.tt: "Reimu Hakurei will be married to Meira when Reimu returns."
 flavor_hkr.15.b: "A Shrine Maiden should remain single."
 flavor_hkr.16.t: "Heresy from Makai"
 flavor_hkr.16.desc: "Rumors come from the North, that the goddess Shinki is reforming the Hakurei Traditions - but unlike how Reimu did it years ago, Shinki is abolishing the praise to all of the Shintoistic deities and made her religion to collect all the faith for herself!"
 flavor_hkr.16.a: "Shinki's making her own religion? Not on my watch!"
 flavor_hkr.16.a.tt: "Get a §YPermanent Claim§! on every province outside of the Makaian states, which follows Shinkism."
 flavor_hkr.17.t: "The Miko and the Witch"
 flavor_hkr.17.desc: "There's no other friendship so well known as the one between Reimu and Marisa. However, even as friends, there are certain things which bring rivalry in their friendship, especially when Incidents become a question. Even though they are friends, they always try to outdo each other and prove themselves as more powerful. While this competition is friendly in nature, it could become one day a problem if one of the two girls starts preying on the other for glory. If [Root.GetName] strikes first, Reimu could finally focus more on solving incidents quicker with Marisa's full support.\nHowever, their friendship has seen way worse and still remained..."
 flavor_hkr.17.a: "I should end this rivalry finally and get Marisa on my side."
 flavor_hkr.17.b: "I will observe Marisa and decide later if we need to end this rivalry."
 flavor_hkr.17.c: "Ah whatever. A little bit of competition never hurts."
 flavor_hkr.20.t: "Youkai Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.20.desc: "Some youkai decided to pay the Hakurei Shrine a visit and dared to go on a fight with [Root.Monarch.GetName]! It didn't take [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] much to defeat these daring youkai though, and in the end, they shared some knowledge about governing with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_hkr.20.a: "It's always fun to beat them up."
 flavor_hkr.21.t: "Human Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.21.desc: "Some humans decided to visit the Hakurei Shrine and gave [Root.Monarch.GetName] directly a donation!"
 flavor_hkr.21.a: "Thank you very much!"
 flavor_hkr.22.t: "Magician Visitor"
 flavor_hkr.22.desc: "Some magicians tried to steal from the temple! Luckily, they are really bad at lying and after talking into their mind, their guilty feelings brought them back to senses, giving their stolen goods back to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_hkr.22.a: "They have yet to learn a lot from Marisa."
 flavor_hkr.23.t: "Old Visitor from the North"
 flavor_hkr.23.desc: "Some old demons from the up north have gotten the idea to visit the Hakurei Shrine. However, the outrage was enormous when they learned that they visited the \"heretical\" Hakurei Shrine and left angrily. However, they forgot on their ways some notes, which are actually quite useful for administration."
 flavor_hkr.23.a: "Well, at least their notes are good mannered."
 flavor_hkr.24.t: "Suika visits the Shrine!"
 flavor_hkr.24.desc: "When she heard that the Shrine got a special sake gift, she just couldn't resist. Suika Ibuki traveled quite a distance through Gensokyo to come back to the Hakurei Shrine just to get a taste for the special sake. However, Reimu still wasn't too happy with Suika's action the last time she was here, so for getting the sake Suika is tasked to repent in heaven and hell and come back a week later."
 flavor_hkr.24.a: "Welp, this should keep her busy for a long time."

 flavor_scr.1.desc: "Most of the time the former rulers Satori and Remilia tolerated each other's presence, but neither of them tried for a better relation between their realms - unlike their little sisters. Flandre and Koishi were always good friends, and now, after their sisters left their thrones, their realms became great allies too."
 flavor_scr.1.a: "Let's hope for a never ending friendship."
 flavor_scr.2.t: "Ludwig van Beethoven"
 flavor_scr.2.desc: "In Austria, a musician becomes famous and beloved for his musical masterpieces. Ludwig van Beethoven was a universal genius widely regarded as the greatest composer who ever lived. He dominated a period of musical history like no other. Rooted in the Classical traditions of Haydn and Mozart, his art reaches out to encompass the new spirit of humanism expressed in the works of Goethe and Schiller, his elder contemporaries in the world of literature, and above all in the ideals of the French Revolution with its passionate concern for the freedom and dignity of the individual. His works made a great impact on the music world and even our [Root.Monarch.GetName] enjoys his compositions - especially Sonata Pathétique, which could be a magnificent theme for our $MONARCHTITLE$."
 flavor_scr.2.a: "Hire this man! I want him to compose a theme for me."
 flavor_scr.2.b: "We need the money for more important things."
 flavor_scr.3.t: "Meiling and the Celestial Empire"
 flavor_scr.3.desc: "The Celestial Empire definitely deserved the title of a \"Mighty Dragon\", but even they couldn't deal with the power of our realm and even lost their capital to us. It is obvious that the Mandate of Heaven is declining. But now there is the question: what should happen with land in China and its citizens? Meiling said she would be happy to visit her homeland again and help her people in these new times."
 flavor_scr.3.a: "She should stay there and manage these lands for us."
 flavor_scr.3.b: "She can visit her home and help her people. But I want her back here after that!"
 flavor_scr.3.c: "She should stay there and build a new Celestial Empire. (Switch tag to Hong)"
 flavor_scr.4.t: "Flandre and the Scarlet Origin"
 flavor_scr.4.desc: "Completely forsaken and overgrown: the place where once the Scarlet Devil Mansion stood is now taken by nature itself. But while this place has been forgotten, the Flemish people of Flanders still remember the Scarlets very well. Flandre is unknowingly visiting not only the origin of her name, but also her and her sister's birthplace - and the local people never forgot the chaos the Scarlet Sisters did in their early years. But at the same time, the Flemish are happy to see a familiar face who could liberate them from the occupation of the other great powers like France, Spain and Austria - and Flandre shall be their queen..."
 flavor_scr.4.a: "If Remilia could see me now. I will rule over both with heart and soul!"
 flavor_scr.4.b: "Ehhm... sure. Let Flandre lead a nation - very far away from ours."
 flavor_scr.4.c: "Flandre can help renovate our old homeland, but she should come back here after that!"
 flavor_scr.4.d: "She should stay there. Perhaps she can even unite the HRE. (Switch tag to Flandrish Realm)" 
 flavor_scr.4.e: "I will rule over them, but I have still an [Root.GovernmentName] to manage."

 flavor_scr.5.t: "Christian Flandrish Realm?"
 flavor_scr.5.desc: "After we left Gensokyo and founded a new nation here in Europe we forgot one thing to handle: while in Gensokyo the Gensokyan Shintoism is the main religion, here in Europe the situation looks different. In our realm a lot of citizens are Christians and prefer a Christian government. Perhaps this isn't a bad idea, if we want to find any friends in Europe..."
 flavor_scr.5.a: "From this day now we hear the word of the Pope!"
 flavor_scr.5.b: "We follow the word of our Patriarch now!"
 flavor_scr.5.c: "The word of the Coptic Pope shall now be our law!"
 flavor_scr.5.d: "The world will burn and only our piety will save us!"

Over time, she became nostalgic for the outside world, especially for the old European land where she spent her childhood, and wanted to rule land and army like her sister. Of course, her sister didn't think to listen to this request.\nOne day, a purple beauty suddenly appeared in a tightly locked basement. She said she would take Flandre to her homeland in Europe, and give her a chance to rule the small country there if she wanted to. How should she respond to this welcome but sudden suggestion? The choice is up to 'you'..."

 flavor_flr.2.t: "The Mistress Leading the Army"
 flavor_flr.2.desc: "Our army and people rose up to fight against the oppressors, but because of the lack of military experience, there is no commander worthy of command. mistress Flandre saw this situation and sent a mana-made clone to lead our army. Seeing the mistress leading the battle from the front, the morale of our troops rise even higher!"
 flavor_flr.2.a: "Glory to Mistress!"
 flavor_flr.2.a.tt: "Flandre’s Clone §Y(4/5/4/2)§! will lead the army"
 flavor_flr.3.t: "A Legitimate Female Candidate"
 flavor_flr.3.desc: "Lex Salica was created to prevent women from inheriting the throne in Francia. But the big premise of this law is that women cannot lead the army! Our mistress has shown her fighting with the army herself(though most of them don't know it's a Clone), which has neutralized the most important basis of this law! Thanks to our presence in the empire and the help of electors who rely on her, our mistress has qualified herself to run for the Emperor's election!"
 flavor_flr.3.a: "Glory to Mistress!"
 flavor_flr.31.t: "On the debris of the Empire"
 flavor_flr.31.desc: "The group of nations that was even shameful to refer to as an empire, which adhered to the old ways and laws, collapsed before our power. German princes and their people are confused about what to do in the face of the rapidly changing situation. The answer given to them is only one and that is to swear allegiance to the great mistress who will build a new empire on the debris of the Old empire!"

 flavor_flr.5.b: "Is that really necessary?"
 flavor_flr.51.t: "Transfer the Brandenburg Electorate to Flandre?"
 flavor_flr.51.desc: "A letter from Flandre, who took control of Brandenburg, has sent us. They are demanding that Brandenburg hand over Electorate's right to them! It's unprecedented, but it's inevitable that they'll have eyes on the gifts they brought with them..."

 flavor_flr.8.t: "The Kaiserin sparks a Fashion Craze"
 flavor_flr.8.desc: "As a candidate for the Holy Roman crown, Countess Flandre Scarlet boasted near-universal support among the prince-electors. This popularity manifested in their votes - and now, in their spending habits. Across the Empire nobles minor and powerful have taken to emulating the new Empress' appearance, adopting her bright blood-colored dresses and comfortable choices in hattery and seeking out cut gems imitative of her distinct multicolored wings. Merchants in Europe have increased their imports of dyes, jewels, and fine cloth in response, hoping to capitalize on the German fashion craze as long as it lasts; flattery may be feigned, but gold is very, very real."
 flavor_flr.8.a: "Nicht die Schönheit entscheidet wen wir lieben-"
 flavor_flr.8.b: "sondern die Liebe entscheidet wen wir schön finden."
 flavor_flr.9.t: "Return to the Gensokyan faith?"
 flavor_flr.9.desc: "Once our realm and our mistress were part of the Scarlet Realm, a nation ruled by Remilia Scarlet in Gensokyo. As such she and her people followed the Hakurei Shintoistic Ways. However, when Flandre got the opportunity to start her own path to glory in Europe she had to change her official religion to Catholic.\nBut now that we have established a considerable power base in Europe as well contact with Gensokyo yet again, Reimu Hakurei is making us an offer to return to the Gensokyan faith. How shall our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] react?"
 flavor_flr.9.a: "The belief of our realm was always Gensokyan at heart. It is time to return to it."

 flavor_mry.1.desc: "Higan, also known as Hell, is the seat of the most powerful goddess Hecatia Lapislazuli as well as the home of mighty yamas - the judges of Gensokyo. Many humans think that Hakurei Clan, Senkai, Myouren Temple and whatnot are the hubs of religious authority in Gensokyo, but this is not true. As in the end they all have to answer in front of the Yamaxanadu, who is currently a follower of the Hakurei Faith.\nFortunately, our goddess Suwako has good contact with Eiki and could convince her to switch the official religion to ours."
 flavor_mry.1.a: "Sure. Let's give her a try."
 flavor_mry.1.b: "It's not worth it."
 flavor_mry.2.t: "Suwako visits the Yama"
 flavor_mry.2.desc: "While the [From.GetName] is our ally, their religious ambitions are quite ... high. Their goal is to enlighten all of Gensokyo to the right path of Shintoism. In the end, none of the religions are really important if a soul lands in Higan for their judgement.\nHowever, Goddess Suwako Moriya visited us personally and empathized on the political importance of our decision to convert to her religion."

 flavor_mki.1.desc: "Our mistress couldn't hold her joy. Dear Alice, one of her beloved children who left Makai years ago was finally found in the Forest of Magic, alongside Marisa. But for some reason both of them couldn't remember the past events as if that particular part of their memory was erased by someone. Every time Alice tried to delve deep into her mind thinking about the person in front of her, it gave the magician a painful headache. It seems reasoning under these circumstances would be quite hard."
 flavor_mki.1.a: "I should still try to talk things out and make Alice remember her past."
 flavor_mki.1.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\" between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Alice!§!\nBecause you know Alice quite well you gain §G[Root.th_additional_diplomatic_boni.GetValue]§! §YDanmaku Power§! for this argument!"
 flavor_mki.1.b: "Negotiations just don't work. We have to bring her to Makai and show everything."

 flavor_mki.2.desc: "In the end, Alice remembered everything from the past - living in Makai, meeting with Reimu and Marisa for the first time, Devil's world and finally opening the door of a picture book. She remembered using for the first and last time that dreadful Grimoire which provoked the future chain of events. Luckily, after we are done with the aftermath of this magic, Shinki and Alice can peacefully reunite."
 flavor_mki.2.a: "Let's live happily together from now on."
 flavor_mki.3.t: "Conclusion of the clash with Alice"
 flavor_mki.3.desc: "Unfortunately, Shinki couldn't reach Alice's mind. No matter how hard she tried, there was an invisible wall blocking the past recollections of the magician girl and even the Devil God was helpless against it. Perhaps, Alice is not ready and time has yet to come..."

For this loyal and firm maid, goddess Shinki decided to collect excellent maids. in Gensokyo - and if they exist in the outside world - the best maids will now have to help Yumeko to serve Shinki!"
 flavor_mki.4.a: "Start the search!"
 flavor_mki.5.t: "New territory of Makai"
 flavor_mki.5.desc: "Our fairies and demons settled in the cold land of the north without difficulty.

 flavor_mki.5.a: "Praise Shinki!"
 flavor_mki.6.t: "Reunion of mother and daughter"
 flavor_mki.6.desc: "Shinki went again to the forest of magic to persuade Alice. Alice still doesn't seem to remember what happened in the past, but seems to be listening for now to her self-proclaimed "mother" who came alone without an army. Maybe Shinki could bring back Alice's old memories?"

 flavor_crd.1.t: "Question of Religious Direction"

While most of our people follow Hakurei's Shintoism ways, a few major places have been converted to Moriya's religion. Additionally the influence of Kanako over Reiuji is unsettlingly high and even Koishi seeks the Moriya Shrine more and more often. How should our realm react to these changes?"
 flavor_crd.1.a: "Call this annoying shrine maiden. Tell her she has a job to do here."
 flavor_crd.1.b: "Why should I care which religion my subjects follow?"
 flavor_crd.1.c: "This Hakurei maiden annoyed me anyway, so why do we not just convert to Moriya?"
 flavor_crd.4.t: "The Fate of Komeiji's Pets"
 flavor_crd.4.desc: "Okuu and Orin, Satori's most faithful pets, have approached our mistress today asking if they'd be allowed to leave Chireiden and see the world. As bold as that request is, Mistress Satori has a tough choice to make! Releasing them might make them happy. But it would be also prudent to keep them under watch. Or disallow them entirely!"

 flavor_sff.1.t: "Question of Religious Direction"
 flavor_sff.1.desc: "The Sunflower Fields is one of the older countries in Gensokyo. Our nation saw the first rise of the Hakurei Religion and the incidents of the past. However, like flowers, religions grow and become more and as such we follow the reformed Hakurei Shintoism. However, many people are still stuck in the past and try to undermine the state's religion by staying with the Hakurei Traditions. How should our realm react to this stubbornness?"
 flavor_sff.1.a: "Forcefully mass converting is just a game. A fun one."
 flavor_sff.1.b: "Why should I care which religion my subjects follow?"

 flavor_myo.24.d:0 "The monasteries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have, however, over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monasteries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."

Centuries later she and other Menreiki, essentially Tsukumogami of masks, arrived in Gensokyo. While they follow Buddhism due to the magic, they acknowledge their origin and connection towards Miko and Taoism, which caused a religious split in Shinkirou. If the Menreiki want to be united they have to decide for one religion..."
 flavor_kko.1.a: "Taoism will lead us to our path!"
 flavor_kko.1.b: "We should follow the buddhistic teachings!"

 ###EVENTS FOR MAYOHIGA###

 flavor_mhg.1.desc: "Nice try player, but you won't abuse the Shogun mechanic AND change your government reform to something else. Now you lose all your Daimyos. But hey, you can still keep your vassals. Props to you for trying it out though. I didn't think you would be so clever ... or stupid."

 flavor_mhg.6.desc: "Broken and defeated, yet her pride is not lost. Remilia and I made a contract not a long time ago: I allow her to start a new life in Gensokyo and she keeps things interesting here. But apparently I became a rival of her without my knowledge why or since when. Usually I don't care if I get on the wrong side of anybody, but with a vampire child on a throne things can go south pretty fast - especially if said vampire child releases a dangerous Scarlet Mist to boost her ego.\nWell, to bad about her ego, because now her precious Mansion is under my control. I think I will let you decide how I should handle this brat."
 flavor_mhg.6.a: "Resolve this rivalry and give her a role as your bodyguard"

 flavor_mhg.7.t: "The Aftermath of the Lunar War"
 flavor_mhg.7.desc: "Over a thousand years ago, the youkai of this planet went to war against the Lunarians of the Moon - and I was the one who declared war and led the armies. This war ended in a complete catastrophe and the youkai had to retreat. I justified the invasion with a hunger of the lunarian power, but I intended a different goal to achieve. You see, I already knew from the get-go that this war will end in a defeat and I wanted to demonstrate to youkai that the idea of conquest is bad.\nIt worked for a long time and Gensokyo was peaceful. Well, WAS. Now in Gensokyo everyone declares war on each other, but this wasn't my main concern.\nIn Eientei, there lives a Lunarian who can clearly remember the terror of war on the moon. In the chaos of today's Gensokyo, this Lunarian could have tried to contact their home and prepare a revenge invasion of Gensokyo. I couldn't afford such a threat, which is why a complete annihilation of Eientei was required. Also, I am not a good loser, but this a completely different topic..."
 flavor_mhg.7.a: "I didn't know such a \"powerful\" youkai could lose at anything..."
 flavor_mhg.7.a.tt: "Don't tempt me, human..." 
 flavor_mhg.8.t: "Restoration of the Hakurei Barrier"
 flavor_mhg.8.desc: "The Hakurei Barrier was an old shield, which prevented all foreign forces from interacting with Gensokyo. It made the continent invisible, unreachable for every non-gensokyan and it was unbreakable. But not all things can exist forever and the Barrier broke, allowing the outworld to see Gensokyo and vice versa. This change from complete isolation allowed Gensokyo to learn from the outworld ideas, but it also made a lot of youkai anxious. The peace of Gensokyo was gone and the little realms started to kill each other.\n\nBut fortunately the glorious nation of [Root.GetName] managed to restore the Hakurei Barrier and gained with it enough authority to demand every gensokyan nation to become its tributary! A new era has started in Gensokyo and it remains to be seen whether the new overlord of Gensokyo can bring back peace to Gensokyo!"
 flavor_mhg.8.a: "A new era indeed."
 flavor_mhg.8.a.tt: "Every gensokyan nation in Gensokyo receives the decision to become our tributary or to become our next target for war."
 flavor_mhg.9.t: "Symbolic Authority"
 flavor_mhg.9.desc: "It works! The news about the new Barrier is spreading throughout Gensokyo! It will take some time, but sooner or later these kids acknowledge my authority again! You see, the many realm leaders already had their conflicts with each other, but because of my role as Gensokyo's guardian they always avoided war. They feared my authority even if I was asleep. The destruction of the previous Barrier was a sign for many rulers here that I \"failed\" my job and therefore I don't have the right to manage the intern problems of Gensokyo. But now the Barrier is back..."
 flavor_mhg.9.a: "Does it mean there will be peace again?"
 flavor_mhg.9.a.tt: "Yes, but not now. And most certainly not within the next two centuries. It will take a lot of time and work, but someday peace and tranquility will return to Gensokyo. Until then we have only the support of my people and good relations with every gensokyan nation. Make the best of it, human."
 flavor_mhg.10.t: "Powerful Daimyo!"
 flavor_mhg.10.desc: "It appears one of your daimyos is grown in power. He decided that he doesn't need your \"competent\" protection any longer. I know this may annoy you, but at least it is entertaining for me."

In history, the terrifying Aztecs got annihilated by the Spaniards.\nIn this timeline, however, the Aztecs are still alive - more and less - and became our subjects. For me, humans are only humans and I don't care what shall happen to these funny bush men. But for this task, I have you, player. Should I modernize this tribe nation and convert them to the gensokyan standards? Or should they remain our little native slaves?"

 flavor_mhg.12.desc: "Ahhh. Do you feel it too, human? The fresh air of the Aztecs high plains, the noises of the deep jungles and the screams of some poor folk getting sacrificed. It almost feels like I've gone back in time again...\nBut enough of this distraction. You and I have to find a \"Blood God\". The \"\" are needed, because this \"God\" is an imposter, who collects tons of blood for some wicked magic, which protects her from my boundary manipulations. Usually I wouldn't care if a youkai kills some humans, but this one is special: 1., this youkai is gone rogue, which means she knows about Gensokyo and could cause more chaos with that knowledge than she knows, which leads us to \n2. She demands way too many sacrifices - even for aztec standards. She attracts far too much attention from the humans.\nAnd now to the last point 3) I don't like it when somebody can hide from my boundary abilities. She has to go. I know she is here somewhere, but I am not sure where exactly. She is either in Mexico, in Cholula or in Sotuta. Human, do me a favor and let your minions conquer these provinces so I can find my friend? That would be nice of you."

 flavor_mhg.14.desc: "Mexico was the heart of the Aztec Empire and is one of the important gold mines of the new world. But the city also houses a secret temple for Quetzalcoatl - one of the many gods outside of Gensokyo I met.\nI couldn't find any sign of the blood youkai, but at least I could bring Quetzal a little gift to his temple."
 flavor_mhg.14.a: "From where do you know a pagan god?"
 flavor_mhg.14.a.tt: "Well, I was bored and I wanted to see how the pagan gods outside of Gensokyo are doing. Are any questions left? No? Good."

 flavor_mhg.15.desc: "You can say what you want about humans , but you gotta give this to them: they know how to build impressive buildings. Unfortunately I think she isn't hiding here, but at least I could visit this pyramid and even some gold here."
 flavor_mhg.15.a: "There's another reason why you hunt her, isn't it?"
 flavor_mhg.15.a.tt: "Well, she sacrificed some of my favourite human subjects. But mostly I want her gone because something which can hide from my boundary skills can't be normal."
 flavor_mhg.16.t: "The Temple of Cholula"
 flavor_mhg.16.desc: "Cholula's temple may not be the most original temple I've seen, but it is still worth seeing. But we aren't here for a sightseeing tour. Ok, give me a second...\n*You see how Yukari opens a gap. She is looking through it and tries to search for something. You try to identify anything in this gap, but the only thing you can see are creepy eyes in darkness. And death screams.*\nWell, this wasn't quite what I hoped to find, but at least I know this girl is doing well... for now.\nEhhmm... is everything ok, human?"
 flavor_mhg.16.a: "WHAT WAS THAT? WHY ARE YOU HERE?"
 flavor_mhg.16.a.tt: "Ohh, nooo. You tried to look through the gap, didn't you? Don't worry. This will go away eventually. Mortals are always extremely concerned if they see the inner of the gap, but someday they get used to it - like Reimu and Marisa."

 flavor_mhg.17.desc: "The long quest has found its end and finally captured this annoying youkai, who played aztec god and killed thousands of people. Now to the question: how should I deal with her? Should I execute her immediately - an act of brutality which will concern your people - or should I bring her back to Gensokyo and let Eiki judge over her?"
 flavor_mhg.17.a: "Do whatever you want..."
 flavor_mhg.17.a.tt: "This is what I wanted to hear.\nFinish the \"Pagan Blood God\" event chain."

We have called names against each other ... so be prepared for a war for japanese honor.\nOn the flip side: my arguments convinced at least the local populations of Hizen. They wish to become part of our nation!"
 flavor_mhg.20.a: "What names exactly did he call you?"
 flavor_mhg.20.a.tt: "He called me an old hag... I was that close to rip his head, but I decided to show him the many chins of his descendants instead."

 flavor_mhg.22.t: "Nagasaki becomes an important trade city!"
 flavor_mhg.22.desc: "Originally the city was nothing more than a village for fishermen. However, this has changed since the Tenno ceded the city to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] supervision, the village evolved into an important trade city with merchants from all around the world."
 flavor_mhg.22.a: "Take this, Portugal!"
 flavor_mhg.22.a.tt: "This option is a reference to the influence of the Portugese, who originally made the village into an important trade city."
 flavor_mhg.23.t: "Emperor approves!"
 flavor_mhg.23.desc: "Apparently all the concubines of the world couldn't make the Emperor resistant against my charm. He accepted the deal with us. Macau is ours."
 flavor_mhg.23.a: "Charm? Say Yukari, you didn't eventually...?"
 flavor_mhg.23.a.tt: "Why should I? It is just a game. And for a partner like you I wouldn't dream to do such a thing, you barbarian."
 flavor_mhg.24.t: "Emperor disapproves!"
 flavor_mhg.24.desc: "He is either extremely wise to mistrust me or extremely blind to NOT see the immense money he would make if we get this city for our trade post.... he called me an old hag, too..."
 flavor_mhg.24.a: "Just take him his province away. I know you can make it happen, hag."
 flavor_mhg.24.a.tt: "First, good idea. I can just take it away.\nAnd Second, I won't hunt you down for calling me a hag. But just because I know the Emperor of China will do this for me. He will keep his core on this land, you know?"

But at least the mixture of so many cultures makes India interesting.\nRegardless, our goal was to find a lunarian and send her back to the moon. Well, while you captured the religious centers I've found this pesky girl. The bad news is: she sold the silk to some random guru and now it is the-gods-know-where. The good news is: she sold this silk for a jewel, which has very important meaning for many pagan humans. This means if you show them our newly found jewel they won't see you as an oppressor.\n*Annoyed gap girl sounds*\nMaybe I should send this lunarian to the sun instead..."
 flavor_mhg.25.a: "At least it's something"
 flavor_mhg.25.a.tt: "This may be true, but I don't like the idea of humans having access to a lunarian item. I think you understand what I mean... I hope the buyer is a crazy, implausible guru so nobody will buy this silk from him..."

 flavor_mhg.28.a.tt: "Nah. Or does our mission tree look like that of Forest of Magic?"
 flavor_mhg.29.t: "Purchase of Hormuz failed!"
 flavor_mhg.29.desc: "Ok. Apparently the owner of an underdeveloped island doesn't want a thousand Ducats. I can understand it. BUT there was no reason to insult me... Human, I think you should punish him!"
 flavor_mhg.29.a: "What's the matter? Why are you now so aggressive?"
 flavor_mhg.29.a.tt: "I hate it when somebody calls me an old hag...\nDON'T you dare to call me a hag, too, human!"
 flavor_mhg.30.t: "Hormuz becomes our puppet!"
 flavor_mhg.30.desc: "Apparently Ran's job was done better than I thought. The sultan of Hormuz doesn't offer us just Hormuz, but his entire nation if we promise him to protect him and his people from any persian, egyptian, turkish or european threat."
 flavor_mhg.30.a: "Please say you accepted his offer..."
 flavor_mhg.30.a.tt: "Of course I did! I could never say no to somebody who wants to become my subject."

 flavor_mhg.31.a: "Wait, Ran screwed a mission up? How?"
 flavor_mhg.31.a.tt: "I think she made an update during her conservation with the sultan or something. I don't know, I am not familiar with shikigamis update procedure. I may be incredible intelligent, but I am not omniscient"

 flavor_mhg.34.desc: "Congratulations! You managed the capital of so many former empires - and this only for me! But there's still one minor problem: how should you manage this city if our entire power base remains in Gensokyo? The people of Constantinople will revolt without any pause...\nYou know what? I feel a little bit generous today, so I give you my idea: I could bring one of the many empires, which held or claimed Constantinople, back and let them manage the city for you. How do you find this plan, human? However, I can bring back either Byzantium or Rûm back (Don't question me. I like the pun possibilities of Rûm...). So, what is your answer, player?"
 flavor_mhg.34.a: "Let the Purple Phoenix rise again!"
 flavor_mhg.34.a.tt: "Are you by any chance a byzantiboo? Regardless, you shall have your Purple Phoenix.\nByzantine Empire will be as our puppet state released. They gain claims of the Greece part of the balkan."

 flavor_mhg.34.b.tt: "Well, should your soldiers ever ask where their Rûm has gone then you know where you have to point on the map.\nRûm will be our puppet state. They gain claims all over Anatolia."
 flavor_mhg.34.c: "Ehh... didn't you have the claim, Yukari?"
 flavor_mhg.34.c.tt: "Heh? Ohh... right, I do have. But I wanted some special blobs on the map too, you know... *sighs* Ok, we can keep the city. At least promise you’ll rename the city into a funny pronunciation of \"Constantinople\"."
 flavor_mhg.35.t: "Elect a Basileus"
 flavor_mhg.35.desc: "After I brought the Byzantine Empire back, we need to give them an appropriate basileus. I could bring one of the former rulers of Byzantium to our dimension with my gaps. Just say which one I should choose."
 flavor_mhg.35.a: "How about Constantine himself?"
 flavor_mhg.35.a.tt: "Ehmm... yeah, sure. Technically he is roman and not byzantine, but I think I make an exception here."
 flavor_mhg.35.b: "The Byzantines need Justinian back!"
 flavor_mhg.35.b.tt: "The title \"the Great\" is justified for Justinian. His rule marked a great time for the Byzantine Empire. His spoken Greek was strange sometimes though."

Apparently she was hiding in the FUTURE and spent a lot of her treasury for coffee. No wonder I couldn't find her earlier. Regardless, after I reminded her and teleported her to the mad lunarians a few times she was finally ready to pay us. Here player, have the cash. I don't need it."
 flavor_mhg.37.a: "Then why did you make this hassle in the first place?"
 flavor_mhg.37.a.tt: "This \"hassle\" wasn't about collecting some worthless money. It was about to give somebody a lecture to hold to their promises. If I can give you advice: if you have bills to pay then do it immediately or else it will come back and bite you in your most valuable place."
 flavor_mhg.38.t: "Purchase of Gibraltar"
 flavor_mhg.38.desc: "It is time to make the Iberians an offer. Because it is kind of your treasury, you should decide how much money you want to throw at them."

Ok, back to business: I see you conquered the lovely city of Königsberg so we have now a good supply of well trained mercs. I have thought about it and I think it would be more fun if we had Prussia as a puppet state. I mean, mercenaries can be really strong, but nothing can really beat Prussian discipline - well, apart from Remilia's military state experiment.\nIf you think Prussia is a little bit too ordinary I could also bring the Teutons back. What would you love to see?"

While you were busy fighting the vikings off I managed to find my friend, the enchanter - a magician youkai, who managed to live with the Swedes together. She improves their arsenal and the humans leave her alone. It is good to see her doing well.\nAnd Apparently the enchanter of the ice was happy to see me too! She gave me some documents about the Kalmar Union I lost, some enchanted weapons for our army and navy!"
 flavor_mhg.43.a: "Say, why isn't this powerful youkai in Gensokyo yet?"
 flavor_mhg.43.a.tt: "Because she doesn't want to live there. You see, Gensokyo is a safe haven for all kinds of youkai, but nobody is forced to live there - especially if you don't draw much attention to you in the outworld. My enchanter friend lived in Scandinavia for so long she became part of the local myths - and she is happy about it."

Of course the pact goes the other way too.\nPlease, let me talk to her. I want to see if she is still corrupted by the tree or not.

 flavor_net.3.t: "Conclusion of the clash with Yukari"
 flavor_net.3.desc: "The mistress' fears are not justified as Yukari is fine and well. But it seems she is confused about Yuyuko's approach. Fortunately, the relationship between her and our mistress is tight so she doesn't seem to be mad at all."

 flavor_eit.1.desc: "With our conquest of Fujiwara we finally ended the national rivalry and now dominate the entire Bamboo Forest. But peace is a rare sight in this forest: Fujiwara may not exist anymore, but the head of this clan, Fujiwara no Mokou, still lives on - and is now part of our realm and causes now internal struggles! Due to Mokou having lived a long time in the forest and knowing every little corner to hide, capturing her and banishing her is nearly impossible.\n\nTo keep this land somewhat stable, Eirin thought out a system of power balance: Mokou and Kaguya are not only literal enemies but also represent different mindsets of how to rule this forest. Whoever dominates the other rival gets to enforce their politics within our land. However, if the power struggle isn't in balance the dominated rival will start to become rebellious.\nThis will be challenging times for our nation until a truce between those hot heads is established."

 flavor_eit.2.t: "The Anti-Lunarian Armor"
 flavor_eit.2.desc: "\"EUREKA!\" yelled Nitori when she came up with her design. The Kappas, Reisen and Eirin tinkered for six months, but now it is done: the first working armor which not only makes its wearer immune to the many purifying weapons of the Lunarian but is also comfortable to wear! In the coming days, this armor will be in mass production and the way back to the Moon is paved!"

 flavor_eit.3.t: "Lunarian Succession"
 flavor_eit.3.desc: "The air stinks after ashes and death. The capital lies mostly in ruins and even the palace is highly damaged. The once mighty realm of the Lunarian is now a place of impurity while [Root.GetAdjective] troops marsh victoriously through the streets. As Kaguya continued her walk through the place she once called home one question came into Kaguya's head: how shall the future of the Lunarian look like?"
 flavor_eit.3.a: "From this day forward we shall be known as Successor of the Lunarian Realm!"

 flavor_eit.3.b: "The Lunarian Realm was flawed. Impure. It is time to make our own destiny."

 flavor_eit.4.desc: "Many years have gone past since Fujiwara became part of [Root.GetName] and many wars, many events have struck our nation. And both Kaguya and her former nemesis Mokou were fighting side by side in Japan. It seems like the rivalry of those two hotheads is finally over! To celebrate this both girls have agreed to act more in our nation's interest instead of their own!"

 flavor_eit.9.t: "The Tenno Succession"
 flavor_eit.9.desc: "Victory music blasts through the air while our soldiers marsh triumphantly through the streets of Kyoto. The time of the former Tenno is over and now the Japanese, the ancestors of our people in Gensokyo, need a new leader. Fortunately, we have somebody in our sleeve, who is not only competent at keeping the Japanese at bay, but is also legitimated: Fujiwara no Mokou, Kaguya's now-former rival! Due to the many tight relations the Fujiwara Clan built over the many centuries within the Imperial Family their clan members are valid and legit in the line of succession - and with Mokou we have somebody at the Japanese throne, who hears to her new best friend.\nAt sunrise, the crowning will take place in the Imperial Palace!"

 flavor_eit.10.t: "The Siege of the Lunarian Palace"

With them in our prison it is only a matter of time until the entire defense of the Lunarian will break apart!"

 flavor_eit.11.desc: "The war with the traitor Kaguya caused deep scars for our nation. Not only hurt them in our population and economically but also in our pride. The worst act however was when they imprisoned our beloved ruler sisters! But now Eientei is no more and Kaguya has yet to be seen. While the former princess is hiding we found the actual, the legitimate rulers of our realm!"

 eit_wata_sis_return_tt: "The Watatsuki Sisters return to the court!"
 flavor_eit.101.t: "Kaguya returns!"

Now, after Terakoya became part of [Root.GetName], the relationship of them can flourish yet again. It even goes so far that Keine is offering her skills for our court!"

Those poor souls have it especially harder since every other nation around them prepares for war is already fighting wars out. Fortunately, they are aware of their situation and of our status as a guardian of the humans. It was no surprise when the mayor of the Human Capital reached out to us and asked us if his land can join ours in order to give the humans the proper protection from all the bloodthirsty youkais around them."

 flavor_fuj.6.t: "Tenno of Japan"
 flavor_fuj.6.desc: "The old Tenno was a weak figurehead for our ancestors. He allowed his general to let a civil war break out and just sit on his throne while his subjects slaughtered each other. This ends now! With our conquest of Japan and the old rights of the Fujiwara Clan, Fujiwara no Mokou is now the last legitimated successor for the Tenno's throne - and under her rule Japan will never fear a Sengoku era again!"

It went so far that one day Keine Kamishirasawa came personally to our court and organized a meeting with Mokou and Kaguya. Her plan is to finish this rivalry - and she managed it... more or less. Thanks to Keine's service, Kaguya was ready to make a deal with Mokou: she will stop with the rivalry when Mokou manages to fulfill the Five Impossible Requests her father never did."

While Mokou prepares the cannon, Kaguya observes her rival from a distance and throws pejorative insults around her. Usually the Swallow's Cowrie Shell is really easy to get, but Kaguya insisted on having a blast of a show...\nMokou said the cannon was ready. It only takes one order to shoot the swallows out of the sky ... or to bring some real entertainment for Mokou..."

 flavor_cin.1.a: "We need her guidance more than ever!"
 flavor_cin.1.b: "She failed us Fairies! Why should we give her another chance of failing us again?!"
 flavor_cin.2.t: "Fairies die hardly"
 flavor_cin.2.desc: "After the tragic death of our previous ruler many of our people are worried about the future of Cirnia. Now [Root.Monarch.GetName] rules over Cirnia, but many fairies are skeptical if [Root.Monarch.GetName] is truly the strongest and wish Cirno back. Fortunately, fairies never really die and will be reborn from the power of nature. Cirno is back and reclaims the throne and while she will always be the icy heart of Cirnia we can't forget [Root.Monarch.GetName]. How will our people answer?"
 flavor_cin.2.a: "Cirno is the true ruler of Cirnia and we will follow her!"
 flavor_cin.2.b: "Give [Root.Monarch.GetName] some time. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will lead us to a glorious future."
 flavor_cin.3.t: "Training of the Strongest"
 flavor_cin.3.desc: "It is common for a fairy ruler to train to maintain the status of the Strongest. Even for the fairies, a basic understanding of economy, diplomacy and military is required to be a legit ruler. Now remains the question which topic [Root.Monarch.GetName] should learn today."
 flavor_cin.3.a: "It is time for some math with money."
 flavor_cin.3.b: "Talking with the neighbours would be a good idea."
 flavor_cin.3.c: "A little training with the soldiers won't do harm."

 flavor_cin.4.desc: "Through fortunate circumstances, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found useful lessons to improve the administration of our country. But it is a complex topic and fairies aren't really known for the intelligence to understand such difficult subjects. Perhaps it is more profitable to sell this knowledge..."

 flavor_cin.4.b: "They may be a little bit too complex for me, but it has still some use for my people."
 flavor_cin.4.c: "These lessons are really difficult. And boring. I will sell them."
 flavor_cin.5.t: "Diplomacy of a Fairy"
 flavor_cin.5.desc: "Fairies aren't really good talkers. They prefer to do stuff instead. But in a world where everyone can declare war on because your words were misunderstood as insults, it is better to have someone who can speak for the fairies. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to fulfil this role, but unfortunately [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] isn't the most skilled diplomat. To change this, our ruler has to speak with other rulers - even if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will embarrass [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]..."
 flavor_cin.5.a: "Embarrassing? Me? Pah... I cannot embarrass myself! I will talk with other rulers with ease!"
 flavor_cin.5.b: "Fortunately, I can speak very well. It won't be as embarrassing as the last time."

 flavor_cin.6.t: "The Art of War - Baka Edition"
 flavor_cin.6.desc: "Wars aren't unknown for fairies. A lot of our people fought and died for their slave masters. But they were mostly used like mercenaries and never had real training. [Root.Monarch.GetName] desires to change this and tries to make Cirinia's troops into a professional army. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacks the knowledge how to train, which means [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to experiment with the many training methods..."
 flavor_cin.6.a: "Well, let the soldiers fight against each other on top of a volcano to make them stronger!"
 flavor_cin.6.b: "A battle royale wasn't the best idea. How about they just drill together with a general?"
 flavor_cin.6.c: "They are already the strongest army in Gensokyo! We should hire more soldiers instead!"

 flavor_cin.7.desc: "Keine is the history teacher and guardian of the Human Capital. She is known for her abilities of \"eating\" and \"creating\" history but also for her good teaching skills.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] used to visit her course, but she was always Keine's poorest student.

This elixir could definitely make [Root.Monarch.GetName] a stronger ruler, or she could give this potion to her replaceable diplomats..."

Mokou is completely immortal, a master of fire and threat for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but fortunately Mokou doesn't care too much about politics as long she has her peace.\nStill, somebody like Mokou would be the perfect training partner for a ice fairy like [Root.Monarch.GetName].

 flavor_yof.1.desc: "The Youkai Forest houses the Pestilence God and our ruler: Hina Kagiyama. While she is not as popular as the other great deities of Gensokyo, she at least gets the attention of her fellow residents of the Youkai forest. However, this changed with the arrival of the Moriya Clan in the west and now some of our people started to worship the gods from the Moriya Clan instead..."
 flavor_yof.1.a: "We already hardly have any worshippers! We need to convince them!"
 flavor_yof.1.b: "Well... I guess we can tolerate their heretical views."
 flavor_yof.1.c: "You know what, the ways of Moriya don't seem thaaat bad..."
 ###EVENTS FOR JAPAN INVADING IN GENSOKYO###
 th_japan_events.1.t: "Conquest of A Legend"
 th_japan_events.1.desc: "For a long time Gensokyo was called a myth - a legend. But in the year 1443 a group of sailors reported a strange flare in the east and have found youkai - mystical creatures from our old mythology. Because of the recent events in Japan there was never an attempt to conquer this land and unite its humans with us, their ancestors, until now!"
 th_japan_events.1.a: "The time has come to tame this wild land."
 th_japan_events.2.t: "Gensokyan Humans"
 th_japan_events.2.desc: "Gensokyo is filled with unnatural people and foes like tengu, kappa, oni and other youkai, but it also houses actual humans! These people emigrated a very long time ago and were thought to be lost and dead in the ocean. Apparently they did not and created their own society in Gensokyo. Their language and tradition is rather outdated but still Japanese. With a little effort the humans can adapt to our modern standards."
 th_japan_events.2.a: "They are still Japanese. We just have to remind them."
 th_japan_events.2.b: "No, there is no need to modernize them. But their culture will enrich ours for sure."
 th_japan_events.2.a.tt: "Every owned Human province will switch their culture to our primary culture, but the Gensokyan humans won't be happy. The cultural adaptation costs in future events less."
 th_japan_events.2.c: "Remind these people too."
 th_japan_events.2.c.tt: "Every owned Human province will switch their culture to our primary culture, but the Gensokyan humans won't be happy."
 th_japan_events.3.t: "A new Shintoism?"
 th_japan_events.3.desc: "When the first Japanese arrived in the land of legends and myths, they brought not only our language but also our religion. After hundreds of years their religion developed to something completely new, yet it still resembles the old ways of Shintoism of Japan. It is unclear, if they are our religious brethren and sisters, heretics or even heathens..."
 th_japan_events.3.a: "They are our brethren and sisters! Their view of Shintoism is now ours!"
 th_japan_events.3.b: "We should allow them to live their Shinto way in harmony with ours."
 th_japan_events.3.c: "There is nothing which resembles their superstition with our religion! They are just heathens!"
 th_japan_events.6.t: "Fujiwara no Mokou"
 th_japan_events.6.desc: "The Fujiwara Clan is an old family in Japan and had a very powerful influence over the Emperor. During the Heian Period they dominated Japanese politics with the marriages of their daughters to the Emperor. One of these daughters was Mokou, who gained immortality by drinking the gift of the Emperor - the Hourai Elixir. After these events, Mokou vanished while her clan declined and split in Japan. \nBut now we found Mokou in this wild land of Gensokyo and she seeks an audience with the Emperor."
 th_japan_events.6.a: "And the Emperor will surely want to meet with her."
 th_japan_events.6.b: "Fujiwara? Now that's a name I haven't heard a long time..."
 th_japan_events.7.t: "Emperor is content"
 th_japan_events.7.desc: "Usually the Emperor isn't involved with the diplomatic and militaristic challenges of our country, but he received a visit from an unusual girl - Fujiwara no Mokou, the last legitimate member of the Fujiwara Clan. \nThe Emperor decided to close the case of the Hourai Elixir and rehabilitated her and the Fujiwara Clan and allowed her to live completely free in Japan. Also the Emperor sent us a generous gift for our expansion into Gensokyo and for helping find this girl."
 th_japan_events.7.a: "We are always happy to help our Emperor."
 th_japan_events.7.b: "We could use this money to help rebuild the Fujiwara Clan."
 ###EVENTS FOR EUROPEANS INVADING IN GENSOKYO###
 th_europe_events.1.t: "Gensokyan Humans"
 th_europe_events.1.desc: "Gensokyo is filled with unnatural people and foes like creatures from fairy tales, but it also houses actual humans! These people resemble Japanese, but their language is quite outdated, according to our interpreter. Regardless, they're still humans and with the right investment we can integrate these in our society."
 th_europe_events.1.a: "Teach them our culture."
 th_europe_events.1.a.tt: "Every owned Human province will switch their culture to our primary culture, but the Gensokyan humans won't be happy. The cultural adaptation costs in the future less and the people won't be angered for a short time."
 th_europe_events.1.b: "No, there is no need to teach them. But their culture will enrich ours for sure."
 th_europe_events.1.c: "Teach them our culture too."
 th_europe_events.1.c.tt: "Every owned Human province will switch their culture to our primary culture, but the Gensokyan humans won't be happy."
 ###TOUHOU SETTING EVENTS###
 touhou_setting.1.t: "Incidents of Gensokyo"
 touhou_setting.1.desc: "Gensokyo is land full of mysteries and magical events. It isn't unusual for us to experience drastic events, which are named as 'Incidents'. These Incidents alter the way the power balance is in Gensokyo and how the player has to watch out for his AI neighbours, because the incidents have very powerful (positive as well as negative) effects for a lot of nations. Now to the question: do you wish to deal with these events, or should I, the merciful Yukari, deactivate them for you?"
 touhou_setting.1.a: "I can handle these 'Incidents' with ease. Now let me play."
 touhou_setting.1.a.tt: "The Incidents remain activated. Note: they are experimental and may or may not be perfectly balanced."
 touhou_setting.1.b: "I don't want to deal with Incidents."
 touhou_setting.1.b.tt: "All Incidents get deactivated and the game continues normally. Note: Once deactivated you can't complete the Incident missions of Hakurei Realm."
 touhou_setting.2.t: "No king rules forever"
 touhou_setting.2.desc: "Greetings mortal. While the concept of mortality isn't real for the majority of us Gensokyan inhabitants this game can't really represent it without 'Rights of Man', which means your ruler will probably die soon. But don't worry! You have me! I grant all ex-immortal rulers a younger age so they will at least survive the next +40 years. Just don't send them on some random huntings. You're welcome."
 touhou_setting.2.a: "Why are ruler personalities not in the base game yet?!"
 touhou_setting.3.t: "The Concept of Mortality"
 touhou_setting.3.desc: "In Gensokyo it is quite common to reach a high age. But Gensokyo has changed. Through a mysterious event the youkai, tengu, satori and other inhabitants of Gensokyo started to age. While the shrine maiden of the Hakurei and Moriya shrine are investigating this incident Yukari, the most powerful youkai, reduced the age of countless rulers in Gensokyo drastically."
 touhou_setting.3.a: "A worrisome fate..."
 touhou_setting.3.b: "Great..."
 touhou_setting.3.c: "Should I have stayed on the moon?"
 touhou_setting.3.d: "Finally I am mortal now."
 touhou_setting.3.e: "As if I wouldn't be busy enough with the normal mortals..."
 touhou_setting.3.f: "Well, if I die it shouldn't be because of age anyway."
 touhou_setting.3.g: "At least the people can't call me an old hag anymore."
 touhou_setting.3.h: "I'm already dead. What will happen if I die again? Will I become alive or what?"
 touhou_setting.3.i: "So I'm now a mortal god now? Wonderful..."
 touhou_setting.3.j: "I didn't know I was immortal to begin with."
 touhou_setting.3.k: "Oh boy. I'm gonna die... again."
 touhou_setting.3.l: "One day I will defeat death once and for all."
 touhou_setting.3.m: "There will be a loooooot of misfortune in the future."
 touhou_setting.3.n: "I remember happy days..."
 touhou_setting.3.o: "Now THESE are some news!"
 touhou_setting.3.p: "Nooo. I don't want the eternal winter to come!"
 touhou_setting.3.q: "Time to make the best out of this."
 touhou_setting.3.r: "Well... at least I have guaranteed place in Hell."
 touhou_setting.3.s: "Dying is ... impure."
 touhou_setting.3.t: "May my statues protect me."
 touhou_setting.3.u: "I don't think I have a mask for this one..."
 touhou_setting.3.v: "This is only a setback."
 touhou_setting.3.w: "Scary..."
 touhou_setting.3.x: "I wonder if the Tengus and Kappas are involved in this..."
 touhou_setting.3.y: "Mortal Lunarians? This is way beyond cursed."
 touhou_setting.3.z: "There has to be a way to defeat death..."
 touhou_setting.3.aa: "Whaat? I am too young to die!"
 touhou_setting.3.ab: "Concerning..."
 touhou_setting.3.ac: "Ehh whatever. As long as I have my sake I have had a good run!"
 touhou_setting.3.ad: "Didn't expect we would join Layla soon..."
 touhou_setting.3.ae: "Don't make me sad now..."
 touhou_setting.3.af: "Now this gives me headaches..."
 touhou_setting.3.ag: "At least I am still not a mount."
 touhou_setting.3.ah: "I just hope everybody leaves me in peace in my last hours."
 touhou_setting.3.ai: "I don't think I can negotiate with death..."
 touhou_setting.3.aj: "Welp, as long our witch power remains..."

 touhou_setting.7.t: "The Male Illusion"
 touhou_setting.7.desc: "This was stressful, but it was a success! I am a ... I am a boy now. Well, or at least I look like one. This is ... a rather uncomfortable experience to be honest - and it takes all of my energy to maintain this illusion. Oh well, I should claim this stupid Defender of Faith title and reclaim my real body soon.\nAnd I should hurry. All the girls around me make me feel ... a little bit warm in the lower body part..."
 touhou_setting.7.a: "The things I do for one more shrine maiden..."
 touhou_setting.8.t: "Disorder in the Flow of Time"
 touhou_setting.8.desc: "Gensokyo is not only a magical place but also one, where time has its own rules. Most of the time it follows the normal timeline like usual, but on rare occasions, it can decide to do \"its own thing\" basically. Now, I could fix this problem and let you experience the incidents in chronological order...\n... or I don't touch time at all and let you experience a random incident. What do you prefer, human?"
 touhou_setting.8.a: "I prefer my incidents in chronological order."
 touhou_setting.8.a.tt: "The Incidents will appear in chronological order. (Scarlet Devil Mist first, then Snow Spring Incident, etc.)"

For everyone curious what happened: here at the Bunbunmaru News we had some technical problems and a very, very angry White Wolf Tengu. I won't name any names, but said wolf caused major havoc and wrecked our printing press. But now they are repaired and we can finally begin to write Gensokyo's news stories, gossip and scandals! Have fun while reading!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*It is possible that the articles are not objective."

 touhou_news.11.desc: "In Gensokyo, the reports of snowfall during May are still extremely high and there is no sign that spring is coming any time soon! The people fear if the winter remains there will be losses on harvests! Reimu and the other shrine maiden are already informed about this incident and preparing for an investigation. The witch Marisa and the maiden Sakuya are also concerned about this development. According to rumors some kind of dead princess is involved in this incident!

Fortunately, she made the following statement: \"What is the matter anyway? Here in Gensokyo we have so much harvest thanks to the Aki Sisters, so the little bit of food I eat cannot hurt the economy...\". We confronted Yuyuko with the newest market price of bread, where she answered she will look outside Gensokyo for food! It is unclear how she will accomplish this goal, but if she satisfies her hunger with food from outside Gensokyo, the price of grain can finally calm down!"

Thanks to her newest invention people can finally play together without the fear of hurting each other - and this pleases humans as well as little vampires likewise! This new technique is already used by Marisa, Yukari and Yuyuko, but will this ever replace the normal danmakus? ONLY THE FUTURE WILL TELL!"
 touhou_news.20.t: "BREAKING NEWS: ALIEN VISITS AND FALSE MAPS!"
 touhou_news.20.desc: "It was a peaceful night. There were no signs for an abnormal observation. But then strange red and blue dots were noticed in the night sky! According to experts, they weren't neither danmaku projectiles nor any known Gensokyan flying in the sky! The humans are afraid, the youkais don't get any rest and even here on the Youkai Mountains we tengu can't get an eye closed since then. Neither the Hakurei Shrine nor the Witch from the Magic of Forest want to say anything about this event. But the appearance of strange dots in the sky weren't the only curious things that happened to Gensokyo! Cartographers noticed this morning that many known places of Gensokyo have been moved and even a huge river appeared in Gensokyo! HAVE ALIENS ALTERED OUR HOMELAND?! YOU WILL KNOW CONCLUSION IN THE NEXT NEWSPAPER!"

 touhou_news.30.desc: "It is only a sliver - a little defect in the light. Something that a normal human wouldn't be able to see the difference. But the many local youkai notice this - and this very badly! The Moon, a long friend of our lovely world we call Earth, is FAKE! The light it emits is only an illusion! And worst thing is: it makes the many weaker youkai of Gensokyo go mad! When the sun sets, the fake moonlight gets mixed with the sunlight, which causes many once so beloved youkai to go insane! There were already reports of rampaging youkais in the Bamboo Forest! IS THIS THE WORK OF ALIENS WHO TRY TO DESTROY GENSOKYO? OR DID DRUNK ONI DESTROY THE MOON AND REPLACED IT WITH A FAKE ONE? BUNBUNMARU NEWS WILL LET YOU KNOW OF THE TRUTH!"
 touhou_news.31.t: "FIRE IN THE BAMBOO FOREST!"
 touhou_news.31.desc: "A massive fire broke out in  the Bamboo forest! Information around this fire is hard to find, but your tengu news team did find them anyway! According to eye and bun witnesses the fire is a product of a fight, which plagues the Bamboo Forest since an eternity: the war between Kaguya Houraisan, a mysterious yet extremely beautiful lady, and Fujiwara no Mokou, a strange girl who likes to lit herself! They've been rivals since both arrived in Gensokyo. Although they both have the highest number of murder attempts at each other, none of them is actually dead! A strange surprise, but a welcome one as Mokou is extremely popular with the other Eientei habitants as well as a good friend with the Human Capital! The Human Capital would suffer a huge loss should Mokou ever die - and our tengus will be the first to let you know if this ever happens!"

The Moon is a dangerous and lifeless rock, filled with crazy people, who would like to enslave simple people like you and me.\"\n\"This is worrisome. Do they want to attack us?\"\n\"Currently not, but I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to do so one day. They have a very strong defense, but you shouldn't underestimate their Moon Rabbit soldiers. Although in the Lunarian eyes the most expensive thing of a Rabbit soldier is their weapon, they are still fearsome warriors, who would kill tengus like you without a blink. My advice is to keep your guards on all the time.\"\n\"Those are some really worrisome news. Do you think the change in the sky is a product of those Lunarians, Ms. Yakumo?\"\n\"Possible. I recognize the magic of this and it is Lunarian nature. But why would the Lunarians want to hide themselves from Gensokyo? Well, either way, my good friend Reimu and I will solve this. You have not to worry, little bird.\"\n\"Thank you for your time, Ms. Yakumo.\""

 touhou_news.33.desc: "Since the day it was revealed that the maps were wrong a lot of new clans and nations found their way to the map of Gensokyo! For a long time it was unknown what exactly their ambitions may have been - until today! We just got the message, that all the new leaders have gathered in the neutral Human Capital and announced their ideas, their traditions and especially their ambitions! Special mentions go to a crazed engineer who yelled about \"tanks\" for several hours and the fairies, who decided to try a new life as pirates! What will this bring to Gensokyo? And are fairy pirates the future?! \"Great! Now my freaking mansion will be raided every day!\", complains Remilia Scarlet regarding that news. Experts are unsure how this announcement will change the balance of power in Gensokyo!"
 touhou_news.40.t: "BACK IN BUSINESS - AGAIN!"
 touhou_news.40.desc: "For everyone who has read the first article months ago this title will look quite familiar, but now the newspaper is back! However, this time we have another story, why the newspaper came delayed: in recent times, we Tengus had internal struggle with some newcomers and disputes about religions - the classic stuff. But the Bunbunmaru News had also some problems with some really, really zealous shrine maidens and their profit oriented goddess. Of course I won't mention names this time too, but be assured: we from the Bunbunmaru News will never put true facts and stories behind profit! With that said that said, have fun with the news of this month and last month!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*The next five pages are filled with random advertisement of Kappa inventions, which are definitely built with profit in mind*"
 touhou_news.41.t: "BREAKING NEWS: A NEW SHRINE OPENS!"
 touhou_news.41.desc: "For a very long time only the Hakurei Shrine was the anchor point for spiritual and religious guidance in Gensokyo - and this was true even waaaay back when the Shrine was still located in the North! But this is about to change! The new Moriya Shrine, right next to our humble newspaper production hub, has officially opened and started their campaign to get more followers! However, rumors have arrived that they also want to close Reimu's dearest shrine and eliminate them as their only competition. HOW WILL THE SHRINE MAIDEN REIMU HAKUREI REACT TO THIS AND WILL GENSOKYO FALL INTO A RELIGIOUS TURMOIL? ONLY THE FUTURE MIGHT SHOW THE ANSWERS!"
 touhou_news.42.t: "MORIYA SHRINE PLANS FOR GENSOKYO"

I don't like formalities.\"\nS: \"Same here too.\"\nBN: \"Oh, ok. Kanako, can you tell us more about your plans with Gensokyo?\"\nK: \"Sure, Aya. But first some background story: you see, my shrine-\"\nS: *Sarcastic coughing*\nK: \"Excuse me. OUR shrine was originally located in the Outworld. And while we have lost faith as the humans were too busy murdering each other, I have witnessed their technological progression and want to bring it to this lovely land of Gensokyo."\nBN: \"Aha. And what about your religious plans? We heard rumors that you two are trying to reform Gensoykan Shintoism.\"\nS: \"It's actually only Kanako who wants to do this. Personally, I'm just here to see how all of her plans fall apart.\" *laughs*\n K: \"Supportive as ever, Suwako... Anyway, yes, the rumors are true. When we arrived here we saw an extremely wasteful style of Shintoism. All the good faith every god wishes to have just vanishes instead of going to the rightful deity and the main head of this religion doesn't seem to care. So for this we've decided to reform it!\"\nBN: \"I see. Well, sadly the time is over now. I thank you two for your time, Kanako and Suwako.\""

Over time it evolved into its own religion and took some aspects of Buddhism and even Taoism, incorporating both to an unique philosophy of life. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Gensokyan identity becomes less and less of an issue and Gensokyan followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

It was designed as a reformation of Hakurei Shintoism, but it still consists of many parts of Taoism, Buddhism and Japanese Shintoism.

 th_confucian_events.4.d: "Taoism is originally a Chinese religion with many parallel to today's Confucian. While it drifted away from its Chinese original, it still contains many teachings of the old philosophy of life, which in turn are essential parts of our religion. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName].

 th_confucian_events.5.t: "Harmonization of Eastern Faiths"
 th_confucian_events.5.d: "The Eastern religion group is ancient and possesses many roots of our religion today, which makes the harmonization of these religions relatively easy. At first the Buddhistic, the Shintoistic and the Confucian didn't accept our new view of religion and philosophy, but as time went by they became more and more integrated in our society. But even our religion adapted to the old ways and integrated the view of gods and karma and confucianism teachings."

 th_confucian_events.6.d: "The old Hakurei Tradition was once the common Hakurei Shintoism in Gensokyo. It shares many similarities with his reformed successor but it was still missing the Spell Card System, which has been a huge part of modern day Gensokyo. Either way, the many followers of this religion have found their place within our nation and adapted to the new Spell Card System while maintaining their icons of the past.  As time goes by the old Hakurei Tradition identity becomes less and less of an issue and Traditional followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.7.d: "Shinkism is viewed by the most Gensokyan as a cult - a heresy, which only allows to worship Shinki, the creator of Makai. Even though Shinkism has abandoned the worship of the other gods of Gensokyo, their principles still are the ones of the Hakurei Traditions, which made their integration in our realm quite easy as the many basics of Buddhism and Shintoism are still found. As time goes by the Shinkistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinkisitic followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.8.t: "Harmonization of Touhou Christian"
 th_confucian_events.8.d: "Touhou Christianity is unlike any other religion in Gensokyo. According to Gensokyo's inhabitants, Touhou Christianity has its origin in the far west in the Outworld. Fortunately, the strong influence of Gensokyo forced the Touhou Christians to adopt many Shintoistic teachings.  As time goes by the Touhou Christian identity becomes less and less of an issue and Christian followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.9.d: "Lunarism is the folk religion of the inhabitants of the Moon and is deep rooted in their culture. The Lunarians are troublesome people, whose national, cultural and religious pride makes it hard to deal with in every aspect. So it wasn't a big surprise the integration of their belief was a costly undertake, but in the end the ideas of tolerance found its way in the Lunarian mindsets."

However, both influential persons have two very different views regarding armed conflicts: while the teachings of Byakuren Hijiri forbids to let fury and anger guide us through the time of war, Shou flows in rage and fury to defend her homeland.

In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter.

 th_taoism_events.14.t:0 "The previous Period"
 th_taoism_events.14.d:0 "Although the circle is a natural phenomenon it is possible for our high Taoistic clerics and the alchemists to manipulate those energies, which allows them to set the period progress back to the previous element."

 th_taoism_events.17.a:0 "Ok." 
 th_taoism_events.18.t:0 "Soldiers want to become Disciples"
 th_taoism_events.18.desc:0 "The life in the army is harsh and everything but peaceful. It is a job of great distress and not everyone is fit for it. As a result of this many soldiers deserted the army and started a new life in the different laboratories and temples as disciples of the Taoistic ways."
 th_taoism_events.18.a:0 "Let them be disciples."
 th_taoism_events.18.b:0 "Get them back in our army immediately!"
 th_taoism_events.19.t:0 "Disciple Reform"
 th_taoism_events.19.desc:0 "Unlike the other religions in Gensokyo, Gensokyan-Taosim is not only managed by its Taoist Priest, but also by its disciples. Those are the adepts, who want to learn from Miko Toyosatomimi the Taoistic ways. And even though they are more used as court servants than really religious pupils, their service in both for the state as well as in alchemy brought some great results. One of those results is a worked out reform for our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 th_taoism_events.19.a:0 "Wonderful."
 th_taoism_events.20.t:0 "Delegation of the Disciples fails!"
 th_taoism_events.20.desc:0 "It may be not obvious, but the disciples of Gensokyan-Taosim are the back pillar of our court and religious institutions. Through an incompetent advisor's mismanagement the delegation of the disciples is all over the place. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has only the means to manage two aspects, but one has to be kept short."
 th_taoism_events.20.a:0 "Well, let's cut the budget for the missionaries."
 th_taoism_events.20.b:0 "I guess the treasury management will be quite tricky for some time."

 th_taoism_events.21.t:0 "The Study of Water"
 th_taoism_events.21.desc:0 "In reference to Wuxing, the Circle of the Five Ways, some disciples started to study the attributes of water and its meaning in the circle. For inspiration those disciples started to leave the temples and the court and do expeditions on the sea. While their curiosity is admirable, their force is heavily missed at the court and in the temples. On the other hand if we let them continue their research, the Burghers would most likely appreciate the knowledge about the naval warfare those disciples find."
 th_taoism_events.21.a:0 "Let them continue their research."
 th_taoism_events.21.b:0 "The temples and the court are more important!"
 th_taoism_events.22.t:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 th_taoism_events.22.desc:0 "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years studying the art of alchemy, diplomacy and warfare. However, the topics are quite complex and it will take special teachers to teach [Root.Heir.GetName] one of the three aspects properly."

 th_taoism_events.23.t:0 "Examination of Administrators"
 th_taoism_events.23.desc:0 "The ancient Taoists of Japan have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Taoistic ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 th_taoism_events.23.a:0 "It is a risk we must take."
 th_taoism_events.23.b:0 "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 th_taoism_events.24.t:0 "Necromancy"
 th_taoism_events.24.desc:0 "In a war many soldiers die on both sides in battle and both parties try to recruit more people for the meat grinder - that is the ugly nature of war. But there might be a way, a means, to avoid this problem for the future duration of this war. Some of the disciples of the Taoistic Necromancer, Seiga Kaku, completed their training and offered us their service during these dire times. Even though their power might be tempting, we should not forget that the dead should rest in peace. If we take this offer our people will be shocked in our [Root.GovernmentName]."

 th_taoism_events.26.t:0 "Talented Disciple manages the Treasury"
 th_taoism_events.26.desc:0 "Apparently, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a good instinct when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] picked [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal court treasurer. The chosen disciple not only manages the money well, but also finds some undocumented cash in some of the chests. According to his advice, it would be smart to invest this money."
 th_taoism_events.26.a:0 "Invest it in mercantilism."
 th_taoism_events.26.b:0 "Invest it in the fight against inflation."
 th_taoism_events.26.c:0 "I will invest it later somewhere else."
 th_taoism_events.27.t:0 "Xiaoren?"
 th_taoism_events.27.d:0 "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan], our imperial heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are, however, factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."
 th_taoism_events.27.a:0 "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for the Palace of [Root.GetName]."

 th_deity_events.1.desc: "One of our young shrine maidens, who swore to serve the Hakurei God, showed great potential in religious as well as fighting matters. She declared herself ready to assist us in our deity's name."
 th_deity_events.1.a: "She should organize our missionaries."
 th_deity_events.1.b: "Her fighting skills will be a great asset at the front."
 th_deity_events.1.c: "The shrine maiden will support our ships with her danmakus."
 th_deity_events.2.t: "Hakurei Festival"
 th_deity_events.2.desc: "The Hakurei festival is a tradition, which started in the Hakurei Shrine. Several youkais, humans, ghosts and what not gather at the shrine to celebrate with the Maiden about their glorious duels in the past. The location for the festival, however, is not set to be at the Hakurei Shrine, which means that every pious Hakurei nation can hold this festival - and this year we have the honor to organize it."
 th_deity_events.2.a: "Let's make us the biggest festival Gensokyo has ever seen!"
 th_deity_events.2.b: "We should spend a little bit of money for a good party."
 th_deity_events.2.c: "Ehh... Not really worth it. Let's make a small part."

 th_deity_events.3.t: "Lucky Year"
 th_deity_events.3.desc: "Reports from our cities say that this year, extremely few accidents have happened. It seems like our whole realm has been blessed by the Hakurei God and enjoys now a time of luck and fortune - well, except for the donation box."

 th_deity_events.3.b: "If only the donation box was blessed…"
 th_deity_events.4.t: "Shrine Maidens visit [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.4.desc: "Some Shrine Maidens and professional Youkai Hunters have visited our realm. They are zealous followers of the Hakurei God deity and when they saw our people worshipping the Hakurei God, they felt like they were home.\nSome days later they made an appearance at the court and wished to show our army some tricks and tips for danmaku battles. With a little engagement from our military advisors, we could even convince them to stay longer for better training."
 th_deity_events.4.a: "We should keep them a little longer."
 th_deity_events.4.b: "We don't have the means for a longer training."
 th_deity_events.5.t: "A Special Gift"
 th_deity_events.5.desc: "So, you have chosen me as your deity, haven't you? Well, that's a little bit unexpected. Usually the gods of Gensokyo get all the attention. Oh well, then I should reward you. How about you tell me what you desire and I will get you something to fulfill this wish..."
 th_deity_events.5.a: "My realm could use a strong military."
 th_deity_events.5.b: "A little bit money wouldn't hurt."
 th_deity_events.5.c: "Can I have some vacations please?"

 th_deity_events.6.desc: "I see your people are worshipping me and trying to appeal me with faith. I am not a god, but I appreciate it.\nHmm... I guess in return I will allow you to use my special spies and diplomats, the Zashiki-Warashis. Take good care of them."
 th_deity_events.6.a: "Thank you, Yukari."
 th_deity_events.7.t: "Spies out of the Gaps"
 th_deity_events.7.desc: "My spies found some ... totally formal correct and approved documents, that this province from [th_hkr_shinto_target_country.GetName] actually belongs to [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.7.a: "Neat."
 th_deity_events.8.t: "An unlikely Quartet"
 th_deity_events.8.desc: "Time, space, dimensions - those are concepts which are not easy to explain for a mortal. But I refuse to think that it is important for you to understand it. More importantly to know is that four souls had it pretty bad in their life and got ... well, what do you people call it nowadays? \"Isekai'd\"? Anyway, there are now four guys, who now found their ways through one of my gaps now into Gensokyo. You can have one of those four very promising people. I will keep the other three for my own court."

 th_deity_events.8.e: "Yukari... you know, that THIS is your court, right?"
 th_deity_events.8.e.tt: "Oh, right. Well, then of course we take all four of them."
 th_deity_events.9.t: "Hecatia, Mistress of Hell"
 th_deity_events.9.desc: "Hecatia is not only the patron of impressive fashion sense, but also the mistress of Hell. As our realm focuses more and more on the worship of her, they also get more and more scared of being sent to hell.\nThis fear increases a lot more when news comes from provinces, which were held by rebel scum, that the occupiers all got banished into oblivion. It seems like our deity is protecting our realm."
 th_deity_events.9.a: "She may be mistress of Hell, but she is also our Guardian Angel."
 th_deity_events.10.t: "Three Body Aspects"
 th_deity_events.10.desc: "Hecatia is a benevolent and supporting deity and stands for her followers. But she also helps outside times of great need. Her ability - splitting into the three divine entities, which represent the forces holding Gensokyo together - allows her to be active at multiple places at once. Hecatia is so friendly and allows us to pick one of her three bodies to serve our realm."
 th_deity_events.10.a: "I choose the Earth Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.b: "I choose the Moon Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.c: "I choose the Otherworld Aspect."
 th_deity_events.11.t: "The Eccentricities of Hecatia"
 th_deity_events.11.desc: "Unlike the other gods of Gensokyo, Hecatia is a little bit ... unique when it comes down to luxuries and especially fashion. And even though money is not a problem for her, it has become a little tradition to collect money to support her fashion choices. Of course this is a complete optional donation, but pious followers of Hecatia would appreciate this gift to her just as much as she does."
 th_deity_events.11.a: "Well, I think a little bit of money to appeal the followers is ok."
 th_deity_events.11.b: "Oh, optional you say? Fine by me."
 th_deity_events.11.c: "Hey, my fashion sense isn't THAT expensive..."
 th_deity_events.12.t: "Rule of Authority"
 th_deity_events.12.desc: "Hell is a harsh place and only the strongest and the most cunning can reign supreme over the other residents of Hell. As a result of this, the leader of this place must show their absolute power either on their own or through their army. A concept which is true in the normal realms of Gensokyo too."
 th_deity_events.12.a: "I am the Authority over my court!"
 th_deity_events.12.b: "I am the Authority over my army!"
 th_deity_events.13.t: "Fort Backdoors"
 th_deity_events.13.desc: "At first our soldiers thought they were dreaming. Hallucinating. But when they practiced the sieging of a fort, they noticed a magical door at the back of the practice castle, which allowed them to take it way faster. Apparently, this door isn't specific to this very castle but to every fortified province our soldiers visit. It is like Okina herself wants us to occupy any fortress our army will have to deal with."
 th_deity_events.13.a: "With those backdoors not many forts can withstand us!"
 th_deity_events.14.t: "The many Secrets of the Court"
 th_deity_events.14.desc: "The court of [Root.GetName] houses [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s closest advisors. However, not all advisors act in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] interests, but in their own. Plots and intrigues are very common in the court. To our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s luck, Okina knows exactly which parts of the court have the most dangerous secrets. One of her backup dancers is offering us one of the three plots of the estates."
 th_deity_events.14.a: "Tell me about the taboos of the shrine maidens."
 th_deity_events.14.b: "Tell me about the secrets of the human guilds."
 th_deity_events.14.c: "Tell me about the intrigues of the youkais."
 th_deity_events.14.d: "I know many secrets..."
 th_deity_events.15.t: "Dancing Explorer"
 th_deity_events.15.desc: "Okina is not a goddess with few followers, but with close - yet dispensable - advisors: her Backup Dancers. But they are not forever useful for her and when the dancers overstay their welcome in Okina's realm, they get replaced. However, instead of just getting them rid, our deity noticed our people's deity and decided to give [Root.GetName]'s court her redundant, but quite curious dancer. It is up to us of how we shall use her."
 th_deity_events.15.a: "This dancer should help us out in our colonies."
 th_deity_events.15.b: "She will do a fine job as an explorer."
 th_deity_events.15.c: "She should use her curiosity in the New World."
 th_deity_events.16.t: "Open Door to a new Province!"
 th_deity_events.16.desc: "It appears that our colonial engagement drew our deity's attention. The idea of us discovering the secrets of the New World appeals to Okina! She decided to give us a little bit of support and opened two doors: one goes to completely new, unclaimed land, the other leads us to our already existing colony. Which door should our colonists step through?"
 th_deity_events.16.a: "Let them take the door to the new province."
 th_deity_events.16.b: "Guide them to our existing colony."
 th_deity_events.17.t: "Gift of the Aki Sisters"
 th_deity_events.17.desc: "The Aki Sisters are benevolent goddesses, who have only so many followers and support. Because of this, they appreciate any support they get way more than any other deity. This year, their harvest was exceptionally well and made them a considerable profit. Now they are selling it and sharing the money with the people, who donate their faith for them."
 th_deity_events.17.a: "That's so nice of them!"
 th_deity_events.18.t: "Aki Sisters bless our Crops"
 th_deity_events.18.desc: "Because of their small group of followers, the Aki Sisters have more time and energy to give to the very few who have chosen them as their deities - those few include us as well. As thanks, they came personally to our farmers and blessed their crops!"
 th_deity_events.18.a: "Blessed be their hearts!"
 th_deity_events.19.t: "The Aki Sisters' Experiences"
 th_deity_events.19.desc: "Both, Shizuha and Minoriko are goddesses, who have lived more lives than any human and most of the youkais. These experiences of so many years combined with their relative long downtime outside autumn both sisters can share their wisdom regarding harvest organization, fertility, calm mindsets and what not."
 th_deity_events.19.a: "Tell me more about the secrets of fertility..."
 th_deity_events.19.b: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will greatly benefit from their experiences."
 th_deity_events.19.c: "A calm mindset sure sounds useful."
 th_deity_events.20.t: "Beauty of Fall"
 th_deity_events.20.desc: "This year's Fall season is a beautiful spectacle of colourful leaves - especially in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName]. The magic of the Aki Sisters motivated many pilgrims to wander and settle in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName] now."
 th_deity_events.20.a: "Nice."
 th_deity_events.20.b: "Fall is indeed the best season."
 th_deity_events.21.t: "Junko's Fury"
 th_deity_events.21.desc: "No other deity is more violent, vengeful and angry than Junko - aspects which can describe our people quite well during these times of war. The question however is, if we should follow her example and embrace her fury or try to maintain the teachings of Hakurei Shintoism and keep a calm head."
 th_deity_events.21.a: "Dire times require dire actions."
 th_deity_events.21.b: "No. We shouldn't let fury consume our mind."
 th_deity_events.22.t: "Purification"
 th_deity_events.22.desc: "Reports have been made from a province that Junko is personally visiting them to do a Purification..."
 th_deity_events.22.a: "Hopefully, its meaning is better than it sounds like..."
 th_deity_events.23.t: "Purge within the Army"
 th_deity_events.23.desc: "Our deity Junko is fighting an endless war against the Lunarian on the moon - and for this task she only needs the best of the best of warriors she can get. To achieve this goal she developed a system involving her purifying ability to purge her army from the weak. Apparently, this cruel act found its way into the heads of our generals, who are now considering the same to increase the army quality. But in the end, it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decision."
 th_deity_events.23.a: "Purge the weak!"
 th_deity_events.23.b: "Only the strongest shall serve!"
 th_deity_events.23.c: "That's a little too brutal - even for an army..."
 th_deity_events.24.t: "Chinese Legacy"
 th_deity_events.24.desc: "Junko wasn't always a deity of Gensokyo. Before she purified her existence, she was known as the wife of an emperor of the ancient Xia-Dynasty in China. But this was a thing of the past. Now she brought her Chinese Legacy - the high art of warfare and the concept of the Mandate of Heaven - to Gensokyo and to all of those, who follow her."
 th_deity_events.24.a: "We will honor this legacy."
 th_deity_events.25.t: "Motherly Affection"
 th_deity_events.25.desc: "Even though Junko is mostly known as the deity of vengeance and wrath, she is also the patron of family and mothers. In a way, she has become a symbol of hope for families, whose fathers and sons are in wars and it is due to the worship of Junko, what gives them the strength to withstand those hard times."
 th_deity_events.25.a: "Junko's blessing upon the families."
 th_deity_events.26.t: "Power of the Word"
 th_deity_events.26.desc: "Sagume Kishin is a powerful being, whose ability is to let the reverse of any possible event happen when she mentions it. It's a very dangerous ability if used without any thought, but in the right hands it can bring massive benefits. Those, who worship Kishin, have a chance to get to enjoy her power for a brief moment - only enough time to say one word, which manipulates our country's fate."
 th_deity_events.26.a: "Poverty."
 th_deity_events.26.b: "Shipwreck."
 th_deity_events.27.t: "Strangers from another World"
 th_deity_events.27.desc: "Some weird strangers once visited our nation. When they saw the might of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy as well as the sailors' piety towards Kishin they decided to visit [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court to meet with our admirals. Apparently, those strangers are Lunarians, who got banished from their home and now seek a new purpose, where their knowledge of Lunarian naval warfare can be useful again."
 th_deity_events.27.a: "They will be from great benefit for our navy."
 th_deity_events.28.t: "The Art of Communication"
 th_deity_events.28.desc: "Due to our people worshipping Sagume Kishin, the goddess of few words, they got inspired by her thoughtfulness of choosing the right words. Many of our merchants started to become quick-witted in her honor and their skills in trading have been improving a lot since. The Burghers are more than happy with this development."
 th_deity_events.28.a: "Less is more."
 th_deity_events.29.t: "The Silent Way"
 th_deity_events.29.desc: "In recent times our people have become a lot less ... vocal about their problems. It seems like everyone found a way to get their quiet and peaceful life."
 th_deity_events.29.a: "Let's hope it stays this way."
 th_deity_events.30.t: "Inspired Architects"
 th_deity_events.30.desc: "With the adoption of Shinki as our official deity, her indirect influence over our country grew. Especially in the topic of architecture. Many architects and builders are interested in using the Makaian architecture for our buildings. However, they will need some support from the government if their dream should become true."
 th_deity_events.30.a: "Of course they get our support."
 th_deity_events.30.b: "We don't have the resources for it."
 th_deity_events.31.t: "Shinki's Scripts"
 th_deity_events.31.desc: "It is commonly known that Shinki's realm, Makai, was created completely from scratch by Shinki. However, it is a mystery how exactly she did - until one day, a witch came to our shrines with scripts and plans. Although they don't explain how her power of creation exactly works, they give a great insight into the calculations and planning Shinki did for her realm."
 th_deity_events.31.a: "[Root.GetName] will greatly benefit from this."
 th_deity_events.32.t: "[Root.GetName] gets flooded by Makaian Gas!"
 th_deity_events.32.desc: "The province [Root.GetName], which is currently under siege, reports of a strange mist filling the city! It comes from the shrines and it affects only the enemy in our land! It can only be caused by our deity Shinki, who wants to protect us!"
 th_deity_events.32.a: "Praised be Shinki!"
 th_deity_events.33.t: "Shinki's Influence grows in [Root.GetName]!"
 th_deity_events.33.desc: "At first it seemed everything normal at the shrine of [Root.GetName]. But after a closer look it is apparent that there are a lot of idols of Shinki and her creations not only in the shrine but also in the town too! It is said that those idols bring luck to them and increase their inspiration in the business of our government. If we let them continue they will bring a lot of good ideas. However, the province will most likely fall under Shinki's religious control."
 th_deity_events.33.a: "Only new ideas can bring our country further."
 th_deity_events.33.b: "We must stop Shinki's influence!"
 th_deity_events.34.t: "Workshop ideas for [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.34.desc: "Keiki, the deity of the worker and craftsmen, has gained a lot of popularity in our realm. In her honor, a group of artists, craftsmen and shrine maidens got the idea to build an idol workshop in [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.34.a: "Sounds good to me."
 th_deity_events.34.b: "There resources are better used somewhere else."
 th_deity_events.35.t: "Idol Soldiers join the Army!"
 th_deity_events.35.desc: "Our deity Keiki noticed our devotion to her. As thanks for the faith she gathers from our people, she sent a battalion of idol soldiers to join our army!"
 th_deity_events.35.a: "Great!"
 th_deity_events.36.t: "Lectures of Keiki"
 th_deity_events.36.desc: "Keiki fights for the human spirits, which are trapped in the Beastial Hell. Due to the constant warfare and authority system of Hell, Keiki developed a system, which allows her to increase her realm's glory by increasing her power grip on the provinces. Although it sounds bad, the human spirits are more appealed by the idea of being ruled by Keiki than under the beasts.\nThe design of this rule is written down in lectures, which somehow found their way in the hands of one of our Shrine Maidens. She donated those lectures to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the future of [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.36.a: "I will use those lectures wisely."
 th_deity_events.37.t: "Mayumi's Army"
 th_deity_events.37.desc: "A Haniwa with a great battalion of Haniwa soldiers marched through our country. But they didn't come as invaders. They were led by Mayumi Joutouguu and heard of our people's support for Keiki. She offers us her and her troops services."
 th_deity_events.37.a: "Well, I gladly take this offer."
 th_deity_events.37.b: "I have to decline. Sorry, Mayumi."
 th_deity_events.37.c: "Offer? Mayumi, did you forget that you serve me already?"
 th_deity_events.38.t: "Misfortune of War"
 th_deity_events.38.desc: "War... War never changes. While the way of how a war is fought may vary over the years the horrors and destruction it brings never changes. It is a time of death and great misfortune. Luckily, our deity Hina Kagiyama likes to collect the misfortune of our people and bring hope for a better future."
 th_deity_events.38.a: "Hina blesses us."
 th_deity_events.39.t: "Visit from Hina"
 th_deity_events.39.desc: "Hina isn't used to people who donate their faith and follow her way. Due to this, Hina decided to visit us and thank us personally. She wants to show her appreciation by offering us to use her ability to free one aspect of [Root.GetName] from bad luck."
 th_deity_events.39.a: "Our administrators could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.39.b: "Our diplomats could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.39.c: "Our warriors could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.40.t: "Spinning Festival"
 th_deity_events.40.desc: "The Spinning Festival is a traditional festival from the Youkai forest, where the youkais enjoy their time with Hina and feast upon the stockpiled misfortune. This year, the festival will be held in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.40.a: "You spin me right round, baby..."
 th_deity_events.40.a.tt: "Every devastated province loses 10 devastation."
 th_deity_events.41.t: "An insane Suggestion"
 th_deity_events.41.desc: "Our overzealous Shrine Maiden got lately an insane idea: in order to collect more faith for Hina and her shrine she asked us to inflict misfortune on our people. We can cause more misfortune by forcing more people to join our forces, taxing the burghers or making the practices in the army more sadistic. However, it is obvious that this shrine maiden doesn’t have the best mental health."
 th_deity_events.41.a: "We need more soldiers anyway..."
 th_deity_events.41.b: "We could press more money out of the burghers while we're at it."
 th_deity_events.41.c: "More sadistic discipline actions should help."
 th_deity_events.41.d: "She is insane! Send this Shrine maiden into exile!"
 th_deity_events.42.t: "Sanae's Fans"
 th_deity_events.42.desc: "Our recruit master couldn't believe his eyes when this happened: Many young men have enlisted themselves in our army very recently! Apparently, somebody spread the rumor that Sanae Kochiya, our current deity, would love to go out with a tough man and now a horde of men want to prove themselves by becoming soldiers."
 th_deity_events.42.a: "Well, I won't complain, but becoming a soldier for a girl's heart..."
 th_deity_events.42.b: "Oh oh... those are a lot of fans..."
 th_deity_events.42.c: "Send them back to their mommies. We don't need them in our army!"
 th_deity_events.43.t: "A Miracle occurs!"
 th_deity_events.43.desc: "Our country is devastated by war and our government is close to the collapse. Everyone seems to be about to lose hope for a better future - until one night. On this night many of our people saw a green light in the sky. And as its light reached them their wounds got healed, their worries overcome!"
 th_deity_events.43.a: "Kochiya blesses us!"
 th_deity_events.44.t: "Wonders of Modernization"
 th_deity_events.44.desc: "The Moriya religion is a modern take on the rather stoic Gensokyan Shintoism. It brings many new ideas from the outworld and even technology. But due to resources being rather limited for this technology only a few can enjoy the modernization caused by Kochiya and her close advisors. Luckily, we are one of those few countries who receives the gift of technology."
 th_deity_events.44.a: "And we sure will put this gift to good use."
 th_deity_events.45.t: "Shrine Maidens move to [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.45.desc: "Some of Sanae's trained Shrine Maidens decided to leave the Shrine to move into the province [Root.GetName]. Not only will they enrich the city [Root.GetCapitalName] but also will they make sure that no heretical ideas will remain in the province."
 th_deity_events.45.a: "Ok."
 th_deity_events.46.t: "A special Shrine Maiden"
 th_deity_events.46.desc: "In the Moriya Shrine a shrine maiden, who had the luck to get to train with Sanae, absolved her final tests. Now this maiden has started her own journey through Gensokyo and travels through many countries. One day, she came to us and decided to stay a bit to help us spread the word of Moriya."
 th_deity_events.46.a: "Make sure she has many provinces to convert!"
 th_deity_events.47.t: "The Walls of [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.47.desc: "[Root.GetName] is one of our fortified provinces in our realm and as such is an important, strategic target. Because of this, our engineers and soldiers pay a lot of attention to keep the fort running. In their last check-up, however, they noticed something strange: the walls of the fort got a new, incredibly hard layer of defense made out of stone and earth. It is apparent that this is the work of our deity Suwako Moriya, who blessed this fort for us!"
 th_deity_events.47.a: "Praised be Moriya."
 th_deity_events.48.t: "Frog Cultists settle in [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.48.desc: "Reports of a strange group have been made from [Root.GetName]. Those \"Frog Cultists\" are over-pious followers of Suwako, our deity, and try to draw her attention by impersonating her affection for frogs. Those folk are a very bizarre sight, but they are of good nature and even amazing sailors."
 th_deity_events.48.a: "As long they don't create chaos there they can stay."
 th_deity_events.49.t: "Suwako's Wisdoms"
 th_deity_events.49.desc: "Suwako Moriya is a goddess, who has seen much in life and even ruled her own kingdom in Japan at one point in history. Since then she has retired from the work of a goddess, but she still likes to provide her wisdom for [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.49.a: "Tell me about the art of administration."
 th_deity_events.49.b: "Tell me about the art of diplomacy."
 th_deity_events.49.c: "Tell me about the art of the military."
 th_deity_events.50.t: "The Three Disciples"
 th_deity_events.50.desc: "Three shrine maidens appeared one day at the [Root.GetAdjective] court. They claim to be Suwako's personal disciples, who were in their last phase of their training, which was serving a court with their abilities. But only one can serve us while the other two continue their journey through the other countries of Gensokyo."
 th_deity_events.50.a: "I take the youkai hunting Shrine Maiden."
 th_deity_events.50.b: "I take the charismatic Shrine Maiden."
 th_deity_events.50.c: "I take the most powerful Shrine Maiden."
 th_deity_events.51.t: "Manipulation of Harvests"
 th_deity_events.51.desc: "This year's harvest was a splendor! The earth itself was fertile and fresh - like it was magically created by a deity! The storage rooms are flooded with grain, fruits and whatnot!"
 th_deity_events.51.a: "This must be the work of Suwako!"
 th_deity_events.52.t: "Divine Inspiration"
 th_deity_events.52.desc: "Kanako Yasaka isn't only a goddess of the sky, but also a militaristic leader and patron over merchants and soldiers. Especially for the military, she is a symbol for victory in a glorious battle, which is why our generals increased the quality and quantity of training for our army."
 th_deity_events.52.a: "Great news!"
 th_deity_events.53.t: "Shrine Maiden reporting for Duty"
 th_deity_events.53.desc: "Due to the connection of Kanako with warfare, it is no surprise that some zealous shrine maidens want to show their devotion in battle. One of those maidens presented exceptionally potential to be a great leader. Now it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] in which area she shall serve."
 th_deity_events.53.a: "She shall lead our armies to victory!"
 th_deity_events.53.b: "She shall lead our navies to victory!"
 th_deity_events.54.t: "Kanako's Lucky Charms"
 th_deity_events.54.desc: "Our shrine maidens donated some lucky charms to our diplomats recently. They say that those lucky charms are blessed by Kanako so their wearer gains more confidence in conversations. It is questionable if they are really blessed by Kanako or just dummies Kanako sells to make money, but apparently our diplomats love them."
 th_deity_events.54.a: "Well, as long the diplomats buy them with their own money."
 th_deity_events.55.t: "The Trade of Faith and Money"
 th_deity_events.55.desc: "Our deity is unlike the other gods of Gensokyo. Kanako sees collecting faith like a business, which means in her eyes she pays us to deliver our faith to her. As a result of this, Kanako was so friendly and sent us her payment."
 th_deity_events.55.a: "If only more gods would pay us for praying for them."
 th_deity_events.56.t: "The Religious Tributaries"
 th_deity_events.56.desc: "Religious Tributaries... this is the name our advisor came up with. It is modeled after Kanako's commercial take on religion and faith and is designed so that our subjects have to pay in faith too for our protection. In return, however, they will get the comfortable feeling that not only their overlord will protect them, but also Kanako's good intentions will be on their side too."
 th_deity_events.56.a: "Interesting..."
 ###EVENTS FOR MRY SHINTOISM###
 TH_mry_shinto_events.3.t: "Control over the Hakurei Shrine"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.3.desc: "The Hakurei Shrine is home of the arch rival Reimu Hakurei, leading head shrine maiden of the heretic religion, Hakurei Shintoism, and Sanae Kochiya's rival. But the time of the fight between Moriya Shinto and Hakurei Shinto is nearing to its end after our religious brethren and sisters conquered this heretic shrine and converted it to the true faith."

 TH_mry_shinto_events.6.a: "Oh no..."
 TH_mry_shinto_events.8.t: "Control over the Spirit Town"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.8.desc: "The Spirit Town is a place where the Human ghosts, who got sent to hell, find safety behind Keiki. Although Keiki is doing a good job, those spirits are lacking a purpose. Thankfully, due to the religious efforts of the Shrine Maiden those ghosts now are able to join the armies of every Moriya Shinto nation."

 TH_mry_shinto_events.13.desc: "Eientei is the seat of the Moon Princess Kaguya Houraisan. But it also houses a small shrine of Sagume Kishin, a Lunarian Goddess. Unlike the other shrines, the shrine maiden of Sagume wasn't difficult to convince them to join Sanae's cause."
 TH_mry_shinto_events.13.a: "Wonderful!"

 TH_mry_shinto_events.18.t: "Control over the Shining Needle Castle"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.18.desc: "The Shining Needle Castle is a small bastion of Hakurei Shintoism in the Foot of the Mountains. And although they tried for a long time to maintain their religious independence, they got converted to the true faith in the end. Fortunately, Suwako is helping the Inchlings through their new time as proud followers of the Moriya ways."

 TH_mry_shinto_events.23.t: "Control over the Youkai Forest"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.23.desc: "The Youkai Forest was one of the borders between Moriya Shintoism and Hakurei Shintoism and its goddess Hina was split between those two religions. This changed however when Suwako managed to convince her for the Moriya cause. Since then Hina swears to support our deity Suwako."
 TH_mry_shinto_events.23.a: "Wonderful!"

 TH_mry_shinto_events.26.a: "Oh no..."
 TH_mry_shinto_events.28.t: "Control over Higan"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.28.desc: "Higan is home of the eager yamas and administrators of hell, but it's also the place of Hecatia Lapislazuli, the mistress of Hell. For Hecatia and her servants they don't care much about religious conflicts and only want to fulfil their service. This laid-backness is very similar to Suwako's personality, which is why now both Hecatia and Suwako come along quite well."
 TH_mry_shinto_events.28.a: "Wonderful!"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.31.t: "Moriya Shinto lost Higan!"

 TH_mry_shinto_events.33.desc: "The Moon was always isolated from the religious conflict in Gensokyo. But in the end even the Lunarian managed to see the light and accepted our faith as the only right one - except for Junko, but Junko has completely different goals anyway. While she continues her hunt after Chang'e, the now mistressless servants swore their loyalty towards Kanako, the new leader of the Moriya Lunarian."

 TH_mry_shinto_events.38.t: "Control over Pandamonium"
 TH_mry_shinto_events.38.desc: "Shinki is one of the oldest goddesses native to Gensokyo. She saw the split of the Hakurei Shintoism in two and witnessed the success of the Moriya faith. When the day came and Kanako made her the offer to side with Moriya, Shinki hesitated, but accepted Kanako's offer. She doesn't like to be under any other body's religious command, but if she had to she would rather follow somebody competent."

One of those places where both powers met each other the most are the shrines. However, because of events involving the red shrine maiden, the nearest Shrine lost its access to the power we seek.\nFortunately, not all is lost.

At each monastic school reside a number of religious scholars, experts within fields such as church history, exegesis of the Holy Scripture, reading, grammar, poetry, music, calligraphy and painting. The monasteries compete to attract the most educated masters and maintain them with great honor and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support.

 th_christian_flavor.28.d:0 "Today, fifty days after Easter, we observe Pentecost. On this sacred day, many centuries ago, our Church was born. The Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the other followers of Christ as tongues of fire. Thus, they spoke the word of the Lord in all the world's languages and converted thousands of souls to the true faith. Hereby began a new era, the messianic age of the Kingdom of God. In memory of this great event, we hold one of the Church's largest celebrations. Together we read from the Bible, sing joyous hymns and kneel in prayer."
 th_christian_flavor.29.t:0 "Feast of Palm Sunday"
 th_christian_flavor.29.d:0 "As Copts, we celebrate Palm Sunday which is one of the Seven Major Lord's Feasts. On the seventh Sunday of the Great Lent, we commemorate and relive Jesus' triumphal entry into the holy city of Jerusalem. It is on this day that He drove away the merchants and moneychangers from the Temple. The crowd who cheeringly greeted the Messiah were waving palm branches over their heads and so do we as we make our way through the church on this happy day.

 th_shinkism_events.1.desc: "The times have changed in Gensokyo. Where once the goddess Shinki once played a great role in Gensokyo's fate, she now has nearly no place on the stage. But not only has Shinki fallen in oblivion, but also the other powerful figures of the North. And as a result of the invading Moriya religion, the Hakurei Tradition has become a rigid, outdated religion. Shinki, the goddess of Makai, has had enough of this!\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of religion. A religion with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as its Supreme Deity, a happy union of the Shrine and the state. Neither Moriya, Hakurei, nor any other foreign religion, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a cult would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority and the people would worship a god, who is actually in charge of Makai."

Of course Mokou had to go to one of my festivals and talk with some foreign diplomats.\" Your voice becomes more angry and you even punch on your desk, scaring Reisen in the next room. \"AND SHE HAD TO PRESENT HERSELF AS OUR DIPLOMAT AND JUST MAKE EVER MISTAKE YOU COULD DO WITH DIPLOMATS! No, Mokou, it is not very lady-like to show your powers by burning the man's clothes. And no, eating the entire buffet empty is just another blunder... Seriously, you want to be called a princess, but when you behave like this the only thing you are is a pig!!\" You breathe deeply. \"Calm down, Kaguya. Anger is not a solution here.

Maybe Kaguya isn't the <natural beauty> everyone is thinking of her after all!\" You start to laugh quietly at the thought, that her entire look is based on cosmetics. \"Anyways, I know she won't clear those bills off.
