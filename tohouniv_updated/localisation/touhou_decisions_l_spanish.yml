 TH_become_scarlett_monarchy_title: "Scarlet Army Reform"
 TH_become_scarlett_monarchy_desc: "We discovered interesting ideas from the far west: a complete, professional reformation of the army.

 TH_become_puppet_master_monarchy_title: "My Own Shogunate of Gensokyo"

 TH_MoH_become_komeiji_monarchy_title: "Celestial Komeiji Diplomacy Reform"
 TH_MoH_become_komeiji_monarchy_desc: "We heard stories of a powerful human dynasty which spread its influence through diplomacy and marriages.

 ###RELIGIOUS DECISIONS###

While our religion differs on many aspects from its ancestor it still has some flaws from those times. One of those is that only a male ruler can claim the title of \"Defender of Faith\".\nFortunately, illusion magic is quite developed in Gensokyo. With an easy spell our mistress will be acknowledged as a male ruler for some time. However, this spell is incredibly tiresome and doesn't allow much energy for effecting ruling."

 th_mry_shinto_province_deity_info_desc: "Our three deities are not native to Gensokyo and many locations and places are completely foreign to them.

 th_buddhism_start_meditation_title: "Start the Meditation"
 th_buddhism_start_meditation_desc: "The goal of many Gensokyan-Buddhists is to find their inner peace and eventually break the cycle of rebirth.
