 HKR_discover_europe_desc:0 "A lot of time has passed since the Breaking of the Hakurei Barrier and a lot of foreigners have come to Gensokyo.

This was the rumored Eternal Night Incident, caused by Lunarian princess, who tried to hide from her people from the moon. To the youkai's appeal the fake Moon didn't persist for long as the princess got defeated."

 HKR_control_over_the_tree_desc:0 "In the Netherwold lives a demonic cherry blossom tree, which attracts many people to their death. While it is sealed by the ghost princess Yuyoko herself it is still a great danger for everyone - and the fact that Yuyoko also has to rule over a realm doesn't help the seal. We should take control over this dangerous tree and reinforce the seals with Hakurei spells."
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_title:0 "Convert the Human Capital"
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_desc:0 "The humans in the Human Capital, the heart of Gensokyo, are kindhearted, but they follow a heretic religion from old times. These Buddhistic minds stray them from the Gensokyan gods and corrupt even more people. We should stop this heresy immediately."
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_title:0 "Stop the Taoistic Heresy"
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_desc:0 "In Gensokyo there's not only the Buddhistic heresy. In recent times a stranger from the ancient land Japan arrived in Gensokyo and converted the local population - only through her charismatic speakings - to the strange religion of Taoism. This 'prince' is a threat for the way of the gods and should be reminded that we are the religious head of Gensokyo."
 HKR_convert_gensokyo_title:0 "Convert Gensokyo"

 HKR_subjugate_sanae_desc:0 "Sanae, the shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, is a lovely person and a worthy rival. Her realm, however, is still a reason for the people of Gensokyo to question our religious authority. We should end this immediately and integrate Sanae's realm and skills in our theocracy."
 HKR_create_an_empire_title:0 "Create the Hakurei Empire"
 HKR_create_an_empire_desc:0 "Gensokyo was for the most part relatively peaceful. But the recent Breaking of the Barrier and the growth of heresy made Gensokyo a place of fighting and wars. If we want to bring peace back we have to create a powerful empire, which can represent an authority for Gensokyo and protect its people from religious and military threats."
 HKR_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 HKR_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 HKR_enlighten_korea_title:0 "Convert Korea"
 HKR_enlighten_korea_desc:0 "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet! The Koreans follow the old way of Confucian, which has many old and useful traditions and mindsets, but it is also outdated. We need to help them so they can follow the way to fortune too!"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_title:0 "Challenge the Dragon"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"

 HKR_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc:0 "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be.

 HKR_expel_the_foreigners_title:0 "Protect Gensokyo"

 HKR_expand_the_hakurei_barrier_title:0 "Expand the New Barrier"
 HKR_expand_the_hakurei_barrier_desc:0 "The old Hakurei Barrier made of magic is lost forever. But this doesn't mean we have failed at our duty as protectors of Gensokyo. Instead we will make a new, naval barrier around Gensokyo and the isles of Micronesia and Taiwan will allow us to build a decent defense line."
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_title:0 "Monopolize The Trade Flows to Gensokyo"
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_desc:0 "The Breaking of the old Barrier isn't that bad: it allows now for interesting and profitable trading with the outer world. Yet, the foreign nations are still not trustworthy. If we monopolize every trade node which flows into Gensokyo we can better prepare for their possible plans of conquest. Ohh... and the profit we will make is nice too. Very nice."

 HKR_gensokyos_investigator_desc:0 "Gensokyo was a relatively peaceful land. But these times are over and now youkais, humans, gods and what not are planning to gain more power or to push their agendas in Gensokyo. It is to Reimu to solve these incidents - and earn some additional money this way."

 HKR_witch_trial_title:0 "Witch Trial"
 HKR_witch_trial_desc:0 "While their friendship is unquestionable, Marisa and Reimu still have their own realms to manage. Additionally, Marisa is eager to show Gensokyo her superiority in power over Reimu and while this is a commendable ambition, it is troublesome when we need the Forest's help. Reimu needs to show her that her skills are still unmatched!"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title:0 "Restore Hakurei Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc:0 "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on the surface at the first step."
 HKR_religious_rivals_title:0 "Religious Rivalry"
 HKR_religious_rivals_desc:0 "On the other side of the Youkai Mountain lives Sanae Kochiya, a outlandish and powerful colleague of Reimu. However, Sanae is a heretic and while their relationship isn't that bad, Sanae causes the lack of donors as her shrine gets all the people! She also showed great ambition to spread her religion to all of Gensokyo and challenged our status! We can't indulge in her any longer!"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_title:0 "End the Rivalry"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_desc:0 "It is time to finally end the rivalry between Moriya and Hakurei! If we ever want to get our authority back in Gensokyo we have to take over the Moriya lands and convert it to the true Shinto ways!"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_title:0 "Influence the Capital"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_desc:0 "Human capital is the biggest city with the largest human population, and the biggest trade center in Gensokyo. Who can control it controls the heart of Gensokyo. Although people there mostly follow our faith, they seldom go to our shrine and donate to us. We must show them the necessity of going to the shrine and open a direct smooth passage from human capital to our shrine."
 HKR_influence_human_capital_tt:0 "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with the owner of Human Capital. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest / subjugation rewards us with military power.\n\nEvery non-[Root.Religion.GetName] province in §YHuman Capital§! or §YFarmlands§! owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country will be converted to §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§!."
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_title:0 "Regulate Myouren Temple"
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_desc:0 "A group of Buddhists, led by Byakuren Hijiri, has landed in the near countryside of the Human Capital. Although they didn't show great desire to spread their faith, they still sought out after control of the capital. We should show them that they can't challenge the status of Hakurei Shinto as the main religion of Gensokyo."
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_title:0 "Eliminate Tenshi!"
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_desc:0 "Tenshi Hinanawi is leading the celestial realm with Taoism faith just like Miko did with Senkai. Although she is far from mainland Gensokyo, Tenshi has the tendency to cause a lot of serious troubles in Gensokyo - and she is quite willing to do so. We should make an example of her and reduce the threat she poses over Gensokyo!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_title:0 "Back to the Past"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_desc:0 "Originally the Hakurei clan as well as Reimu Hakurei used to live in the northern part of Gensokyo. However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategically important south so the resources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_tt:0 "Every province owned by [Root.GetName] or its subjects in §YEastern§! and §YWestern Old Hakurei Shrine§! will §Close§! all separatism and autonomy and gain the §YCall to Arms for Reimu§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Manpower: §G25%§!\n"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_title:0 "Devil from the Past"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_desc:0 "We are back to the old Hakurei Shrine, a relic of old times. But now that we've returned we have to face the old neighbors too: Shinki, the powerful creator and goddess of Makai, has shown a great desire to increase her own status in Gensokyo. She tried to establish a new religion and to spread that to all Gensokyans. Although she is a goddess, we can't allow such actions. We have to shut her down and make sure no evil creature or mind will ever come out of Makai."
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_no_province:0 "No province outside of §YMakai Coast§!, §YWestern Makai§!, §YMakai§! and §YMakai Peninsula§! follows §YShinkism§!."

 HKR_train_a_miko_army_title:0 "Train the Miko Army"
 HKR_train_a_miko_army_desc:0 "While spellcards are still the norm of duels it won't protect a realm. Every country is building their very own army to compete for a higher status in Gensokyo. As the regulator of Gensokyo in name, we must build our own army now to make this name justified!"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_title:0 "Defeat the Scarlet Devil"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_desc:0 "Remilia Scarlet is a weird person - even for Gensokyan standards. While her nature as a vampire suggests only bad things for humans and our realm, her behaviour is in complete contrast to it as she rarely even interact with humans.\nStill, Remilia has the title of the \"Scarlet Devil\" and we heard that she plans on militarizing the fairies working for her. Because of these circumstances we should strike on her first."
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_title:0 "Suppress Former Hell"
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_desc:0 "The Former Hell, once a place where the evil souls atone for their sins, is now home of the banished, trouble seeking onis, the sinister satoris and other dangerous youkais. While the other residents are not threatening the balance of power in Gensokyo, the oni though might be different: rumors tell that they are gathering power to try to retake the Youkai Mountain - and eventually more from Gensokyo. And the satoris, who are supposed to control them, aren't much trustworthy either. We should take control over these threats ourselves and cleanse heretics on the way."
 hkr_mission_to_not_hakurei_tt:0 "Every province in §YFormer Hell§! that is owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country but not itself [Root.Religion.GetName] will gain the §YShrine Maidens on Mission§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Missionary Maintenance Cost: §G-25.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §G+3.0%§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!\n"

 HKR_demons_of_higan_title:0 "The Animalistic Threat"
 HKR_demons_of_higan_desc:0 "Usually they have little to no business for the living in Hell, but shrine maidens reported beast spirits leaving Hell and taking the living in Gensokyo! Of course Reimu reacted quickly and eliminated these spirits as well as challenged those who unleashed them to the mortal world.\nHowever, the rulers - those who let these spirits free - still live on in the Animal Realm of Hell. If we want to make sure that there will never again be a threat from them we have to subjugate their rulers."

 HKR_gather_allies_title:0 "Gather Allies"
 HKR_gather_allies_desc:0 "The times have changed in Gensokyo and every inhabitant of this once so peaceful land knows it. Youkais gather fairies and train them to soldiers, humans start praying to Gods of Wars and heresies are about to be created.\nWhile our shrines have competent defenders, they are no match against an overwhelming force during times of wars. We must ensure the survival of our [Root.GovernmentName] by gathering devout allies."

 HKR_great_power_title:0 "Gensokyo's Great Powers"
 HKR_great_power_desc:0 "It's obvious that some realms have more influence and power in Gensokyo than others. As our goal is to keep Gensokyo safe from outer and inner threats we must make sure that we belong to the great powers of Gensokyo or else any attempt to keep the religious unity and peace in Gensokyo will be doomed to fail."
 HKR_disciplined_shrine_maidens_title:0 "Shrine Maiden Discipline"
 HKR_disciplined_shrine_maidens_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is no [Root.GovernmentName] of war, but sometimes the religious safety of Gensokyo can only be achieved by the sword - like in the case with the Taoists. For this reason many of the young shrine maidens shall now undergo the same training and traditions as Reimu Hakurei, our devout ruling Shrine Maiden, did in the past to make sure that future wars will be easier than the one we had against the former crown prince."

 HKR_eliminate_the_fairies_title:0 "The Three Fairies"
 HKR_eliminate_the_fairies_desc:0 "Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire are the leaders of Sangetsusei - and the cause for many, many costly pranks at the Hakurei Shrine. Reimu's donation box is already running low so having the three fairies causing more troubles than good is not beneficial to our economy. We should take them and the other fairies near them out to make sure that no \"prank\" will be ever played on us again."
 HKR_future_of_shinto_title:0 "Future of Shintoism"
 HKR_future_of_shinto_desc:0 "Hakurei Shintoism is an evolved denomination of the original Japanese Shintoism.

 HKR_reimu_forever_desc:0 "The future of our religion and our realm is secured and the divine Hakurei God is more than pleased with the state of Reimu's accomplishments as both devout shrine maiden and resolute protector of Gensokyo. Now the time has finally come to receive the eternal blessing!"
 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_title:0 "Lady of the Borders"
 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_desc:0 "Reimu Hakurei and Yukari Yakumo have a strange relationship: while they both serve Gensokyo by maintaining the Hakurei Barrier, they both have a lot of arguments and teasing. However, unlike Reimu, Yukari has a lot of potential to cause a lot of chaos not only in Gensokyo but also outside and due to her complex mind it's not easy to understand her schemes.\nIt would be beneficial for everyone when she and Reimu reform the Barrier Team again."
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_title:0 "Future of [Root.GetName]"
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_desc:0 "The [Root.GovernmentName] has overcome wars, incidents and the Donation Box Curse. But we shouldn't rest on the achievements of the past and make sure that the future of the Hakurei Realm is ensured!"

 HKR_new_power_distribution_desc:0 "Suika Ibuki is a traveling Oni, who likes to drink and cause brawls. While she is not a resident of the Hakurei Shrine per se, she is still a very often seen person at the Hakurei Shrine. One day, the shrine maiden, the humans and Suika got in a conflict at the shrine, which ended in a hefty brawl and Suika leaving [Root.GetName].\nWhile she is already gone, it got revealed later that the youkais of our realm planned this conflict to get more influence within the [Root.GovernmentName]. Now it is up to Reimu to solve this conflict between shrine maidens, humans and youkais."
 HKR_expand_the_shrines_title:0 "Land of Shrines"
 HKR_expand_the_shrines_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is a [Root.GovernmentName] of religion. Therefore it is imperative that every person - be it human or youkai - can visit a shrine to give donations.

 FOM_beyond_the_barrier_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier is a great shield which protects the youkai from the Outside. But in recent times it has cracked and its influence over Gensokyo vanished slowly.

 FOM_discover_europe_title:0 "Discover Europe"
 FOM_discover_europe_desc:0 "The great magician Alice Margatroid once told us the origin of the witches: a continent called Europe in the far west.

 FOM_get_full_access_to_voile_library_desc:0 "In the Scarlet Mansion there's a huge library full of magical tomes, books with ancient knowledge and even some forbidden writings. Usually Marisa could always 'borrow' some of these books but with the recent events everyone in Gensokyo became more tense and Marisa has lost her access to the library.

Fortunately, there are people who could help us out: the Kappa in the west have advanced technology, which they use for incredible things like sucking air from the environment, but they're completely unorganized and until they find the machines we need we would've already died from age.\nAlternatively we can hijack the space vessel of Okazaki. Her technology is on par with those of the kappas, but she won't give it to us on her own. Either way, we need to take control over either realm and reorganize them for our purpose."

One day our clan split into two parts: the majority stayed and improved the influence within the royal family while the other part followed Lady Mokou.

 FUJ_control_etna_title:0 "Control Mount Etna"
 FUJ_control_etna_desc:0 "Many Italian myths and legends tell about the volcano Etna. It is speculated that this very mountain is the blacksmith of the Roman god Volcanus. The Scarlet Devil never confirmed of the existance of the old gods in Europe, but the flames and fire of this volcano are a good sign that there's maybe more truth to the myths.

 ###MISSION FOR MKI###
 MKI_form_the_makai_navy_title:0 "Form the Makai Navy"
 MKI_form_the_makai_navy_desc:0 "Generally speaking, Makai is an isolated world inhabited by demons and a supreme creation of Mistress Shinki. No human can survive here for long because of poisonous miasma. Though after many years of its existence, our people always wondered what lays on the other side of the barrier. We should build up an immense navy in order to satisfy the curiosity of our nation to explore the outside world."
 MKI_break_the_barrier_title:0 "Reach the Outworld"
 MKI_break_the_barrier_desc:0 "According to our tourists' reports, behind the Gate to Makai lies Gensokyo. But not just that, it seems even this huge piece of land is only a fraction of the outside world. Tourists say that up until recently it was separated by another barrier - the Great Hakurei Border, which is now gone for good. We should exploit this possibility to go and look for even more new lands!"
 MKI_discover_europe_title:0 "Discover Europe"
 MKI_discover_europe_desc:0 "Outside world sure is a huge mystery for us. According to various questionable rumours circulating recently, there is a remote continent called... I believe it was "Europe" or something? Little is known to us, some tourists even doubt its existence. Whatever the case, we have to explore the uncharted waters and find the truth for ourselves!"
 MKI_rally_the_troops_title:0 "Rally the troops"
 MKI_rally_the_troops_desc:0 "Since the barrier between Gensokyo and Makai is no more it makes us vulnerable to an invasion from the outside, but it also brings us a lot of new possibilities. We should be assured to have a truly top-notch army for our demon realm before we start to act."

 MKI_pay_old_friend_visit_desc:0 "A while ago one suspicious individual, claiming to be a so-called "Eternal shrine maiden" burst into our realm and caused some significant damage to capital infrastructure. Now we should visit Reimu and gently ask her to pay the expenses for Pandaemonium renovations. According to our information, the portal which connects Makai and Eastern country is located just beside her shrine. This trip shouldn't take too long..."
 MKI_search_heroines_whereabouts_title:0 "Search heroines' whereabouts"
 MKI_search_heroines_whereabouts_desc:0 "Well, too bad. It didn't go as smooth as we thought. Turns out, this shrine was already abandoned a long time ago and only another weird individual named Meira was found near it. During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Reimu's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

 MKI_audience_with_yuuka_desc:0 "Well, in the end we did find at least one person from before who perfectly remembers all the events from that incident - a vengeful spirit Mima. She refused to cover any expenses whatsoever (unsurprisingly) but shared a fair amount of information. According to her, Reimu moved to a new shrine somewhere far away almost right after her return from Makai. Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice. There is only one person left, whose location we can confirm - Yuuka, an ominous flower lady living in a mansion called Mugenkan. Maybe she can clear things up regarding Reimu and Marisa?"
 MKI_travelling_among_humans_title:0 "Travelling among the humans"
 MKI_travelling_among_humans_desc:0 "Well, after some strolling through the flower fields, our mistress had a fine rest during tea time in a mansion of Mugenkan. Although it seems its owner nowadays prefers to spend more of her time among sunflowers, they seem to be the same person from before. Yuuka was a little surprised to meet our mistress under these circumstances and apparently she denied any accusations of plundering our realm. Still she did make remarks about the people we are interested in. Wonderful shrine maiden of paradise Reimu, ordinary magician Marisa and even our Alice - the seven-colored puppeteer. She seems to know the locations of them all. Both Alice and Marisa live now deep in a Forest of Magic in their own realm, while the new Hakurei Shrine is located somewhere to the south. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and humans alike. Also she mentioned a certain man named Rinnosuke, who sells Alice and Marisa goods once in a while, he can be found in his shop "Kourindou"."

 MKI_capture_ruukoto_desc:0 "Our tourists visiting Old Hakurei Shrine and Yumemi's spaceship reported a strange individual in different areas of Gensokyo.

 MKI_capture_sakuya_desc:0 "Various stories coming to us from mainland Gensokyo are telling about an elegant maid from Scarlet Devil Mansion who mastered time manipulation, Sakuya Izayoi. More to that, she is quite skillful in danmaku and close combat. We should find her and invite to Makai!"
 MKI_capture_vivit_title:0 "Capture Vivit"
 MKI_capture_vivit_desc:0 "This one is a bit tricky. The only information we have are questionable references in some of Yumemi's papers regarding other parallel worlds. According to them, VIVIT is a combat maid-type robot from future powered by mysterious cactus energy. It may be rather hard to find her in this world, but the papers mentioned she was looking for a Holy Grail.\nAccording to another report from Yumemi, the Holy Grail seems to be located in a ruined city near Jerusalem. It's clear she's around here, but we can't figure out the exact location in the end, so we have no choice but to look for as many areas as possible..."

It is rumoured that near the Human village there is the Myouren Temple, where another acquaintance resides - lady Byakuren Hijiri, who was sealed in our world by ungrateful humans.

While there are opinions in our country that we should go outside by the stimulus of this move, there are also many opposing views that we are located north of Gensokyo, so there is nothing we can gain from trade with the outside world.\nMeanwhile, some challenging explorers and merchants are arguing that if we don't benefit from the South and the West, there might be something we're looking for in the North.

 MKI_fortify_east_siberia_desc:0 "We have successfully taken control of East Siberia and are using its resources for us. Our conquerors and captives report that there is also a large land on the west too. We could go straight to conquer it, but it would be a better strategy to bring aggressors from there who seek our land here and lead to self-destruction. If we prepare a suitable fortress to defend against foreign invasions, the goddess Shinki will personally turn this fortress into an impenetrable frozen stronghold!"

 MRY_suwakos_mishaguji_title:0 "Mishaguji"
 MRY_suwakos_mishaguji_desc:0 "Mishagujis are curse gods brought by Suwako to Gensokyo. While they bring curses to people they also amplify the faith Kanako and Suwako gain. As such these beastial gods’ demands should be pleased. One of their most important desires are places to rest, which means we have to prepare some of our provinces for them."

While what kind of religion she has to base her judgement on is trivial to her (as she always judges the purity of the soul anyways), it plays a huge role for the people of Gensokyo. We will show our superiority when we manage to get the judge of the dead to approve our ways!"
 MRY_eikis_approval_tt:0 "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with Eiki. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest rewards us with military power."

And while youkai bring a fair amount of faith to Kanako, their contributions are peanuts compared to the faith humans bring. Sadly, the closest human settlements in our area serve hell and don't bring much faith. However, the humans from the Human Capital are a lot more profitable.
