Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstandment she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn. Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."

 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo.

 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just march into Reimaden ourself and take the orbs from Mima."

Just how our Shrine Maiden expected, Shion's precense caused for a massive financial crisis in there!\nHowever, Shion noted that she prefers to not be used like that in the future and wants to help us by making loan sharks go bankrupt instead."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury.

 flavor_hkr.25.t: "Part 0: Origin of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hkr.25.desc: "A long time ago youkais and humans lived side by side on the normal world in a symbiotic relationship as Youkais nourish on the human emotions and faith while the humans profit from the youkai by using their powers for humankind. However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkais. However, the youkais needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."
 flavor_hkr.25.a: "Yeah ok, nice origin story for the continent, but what about the Hakurei Clan?"
 flavor_hkr.26.t: "Part 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers"
 flavor_hkr.26.desc: "Originally, our country has been a clan of shrine maidens and guardians from Japan. A role, which we now fulfill in Gensokyo today too. But our current position in Gensokyo wasn't always our home. Before that we lived in the high north of Gensokyo until the early incidents, which were investigated by Reimu Hakurei.\n\nThe first incident was about about the sudden destruction of the Hakurei Shrine, the heart of our realm. The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell. After several bloody battles and the first encounter with Mima, Reimu managed to defeat Konngara with the power of the unstable Yin-Yang Orbs. Not much is known about this incident later on though and only Konngara and Mima might know more from it."

Nowadays, Konngara is enjoying a calm life in the remains of Hell's oldest location, the Silent Temple. However, back then she was the culprit of the first destruction of the Old Hakurei Shrine and got confronted by Reimu."

But this only remained for a short duration as one day the shrine was invaded by hellish monsters of unknown origin. As exterminating these monsters did not stop them from returning, Reimu decided to visit the Old Hell again. During her journey she encountered and defeated the Engineer Rika and the the Samurai Meira.\n\nWhen Reimu entered the realm of Reimaden a young witch tried to stop her. It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw eachother as enemies and could not stand eachother. However, after Marisa's and Mima's unavoidable defeat, Marisa decided to leave Reimaden to discover the wonders of Gensokyo on her own..."

 flavor_hkr.271.desc: "No ghost is as infamous as Mima is within Gensokyo. There have been rumors that she will come back and that her return will mean the end of Gensokyo. Reimu remembers the chaos that Mima has caused back in the days with her summoning of hellish creatures within the Hakurei Shrine - and Reimu had enough of that. When she confronted Mima in Reimaden it came to an epic battle between these two."

As rumors of wishfulfilling being have reached the rest of Gensokyan many people traveled to the Fantasy Ruins to harness the power for themselves.

 flavor_hkr.281.desc: "Not much is known about the ones, who call themselves \"Time Traveler\" other than that they do their name justice. Although they are a mystery for the usual Gensokyan, Reimu can remember when Yumemi Okazaki, the leader of the Time Travelers, crashed into the Back Mountain. In order to hide themselves, they disguised their \"ship\" as ruins. However, Yumemi's assistant, Chiyuri, had to spread a rumor of a genie in the Fantasy Ruins, which eventually lead to Reimu facing off Yumemi."

When Reimu tried to finally relax the Hakurei Shrine got invaded by dozens and dozens of youkais. She and her former enemy and now good friend Marisa were more than annoyed by the sheer influx of new youkais. They went out to seal the source of these new youkais, which led them eventually to Mugenkan, the mansion of Yuuka Kazami.

Reimu Hakurei was exhausted, but she could not let these demons stay in Gensokyo. So the young shrine maiden traveled to Makai, followed by Marisa, Mima and Yuuka. On her journey she saw how powerful demons surpressed youkais and how danmakus are used against inobedient fairies. After many fights, which almost ended lethally for Reimu, she managed to confront Shinki in Pandæmonium and defeated her barely..."

 flavor_hkr.301.desc: "The Goddess of Creation, the Mistress of Makai and Mother of Alice Margatroid. There might be more titles, but Shinki always uses these three. Nobody in Gensokyo was as difficult and dangerous to defeat for Reimu than Shinki - especially since there was no security during a Danmaku Duel back then. The fight against Shinki was one to life and death for herself. One she luckily won."
 flavor_hkr.301.a: "Fortunately, Shinki is a nowadays a lot calmer."

All what is left are the foundations of the shrine and the donation box. After minutes which felt like hours of grief, the silence has been broken by the arrival of a person. She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkais and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her. She led the survivors of our people to the South of Gensokyo to rebuild the Clan and the Shrine there."

 flavor_hkr.32.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.32.desc: "In the mean time a new power has entered Gensokyo's stage: Scarlet Realm, led by the vampire Remilia Scarlet. Remilia brought spells and powers from the far west, which were exceeding anything before in raw spell power. After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."
 flavor_hkr.32.a: "Go on."
 flavor_hkr.33.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.33.desc: "Reimu then trained several new shrine maidens in the teachings of youkai extermination, danmaku battles and the new Spell Card System. She managed to convert many people - be it youkais or humans - to Hakurei Shintoism, teaching them to stick to the Spell Card rules. It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has beed spreaded from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of shintoism and fighting. This movement later became the \"Hakurei Tradition\"."

 flavor_hkr.34.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.34.desc: "While all that was happening, Marisa Kirisame decided to move away too. During her journey in Makai she found a new colleague: Alice Margatroid. Despite their differences and conflicts they became good friends. They turned their back to North Gensokyo when they heard about Reimu and her implementing the Spell Card System in Gensokyo and decided to settle in the Forest of Magic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mima tried to become a god on her own, but got bored eventually and returned to Reimaden. It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."

After searching in Lily's minds, Satori learns that this weak fairy seeks Chireiden's support against Remilia Scarlet.\nWhile Lily is very unimpressive, her little home does actually have strategical potential.

In return, the fairies of [Root.GetName] serve Satori in her campaign shall the Scarlet Devil be eliminated - and now Satori reminds Lily of this pact quite drastically.\nLily now has to decide if she wants our realm to submit to the satori or if she wants us to deny this pact and risk a war against Chireiden..."

 ###MISSIONS FOR LAR###
 LAR_prepare_army_title: "Prepare an Army"
 LAR_prepare_army_desc: "Unlike the other fairies, warfare is not in our nature. However, these fairy wars are escalating more and more! We need an army of fairy volunteers, who defend our home should one of our neighbours decide to invade us!"
 LAR_smash_lily_title: "Herald of Spring"
 LAR_smash_lily_desc: "Lily White is our direct neighbour. Our good fairy lady Eternity and Lily represent both the better seasons, which are Spring and Summer and as such they both have similar traits and goals. However, Lily is weak and her only purpose is to annoy others with her call \"Spring has come\". She needs to find her place within [Root.GetName] so she can learn from Eternity true fairy strength."
 LAR_smash_prismriver_title: "The Prismriver Sisters"
 LAR_smash_prismriver_desc: "Just like Lily, the Prismriver Sisters are noisy people. Way too noisy for our good mistress! We should stop there music playing!\nAnd while we're at it we could get good use of their earnings with their noise."
 LAR_smash_hina_title: "Gods of the Youkai Forest"
 LAR_smash_hina_desc: "Eternity Larva is not any fairy but one with an unknown backstory. Many other fairies speculated that something is weird with Eternity and while it sounded very mean at the beginning, it was later implied that Larva might have been something more. Something more powerful than any fairy; maybe even a goddess! However, she is not sure about it herself yet and wants to prove it. A good way to proof your strength is by defeating other gods - like Hina and the Aki Sisters!"
 LAR_form_alliances_title: "Diplomacy in Gensokyo"
 LAR_form_alliances_desc: "Diplomacy in Gensokyo is already hard enough, but being a fairy mistress, who is not well known in Gensokyo? Diplomacy is nearly impossible in Gensokyo then. Fortunately, if we manage to get at least one single ally we can prove ourselves that we are not as bad in diplomacy than the usual fairy."
 LAR_smash_three_fairies_title: "End the Fairy Wars"
 LAR_smash_three_fairies_desc: "The Three Fairies are bullies and always tried to unite us fairies by combusting our homes! They are not aware that their behaviour is only dangerous for our kind. We have to teach them a lesson and show them that their way is wrong!"
 LAR_smash_cirno_title: "Ice Brain Fairy"
 LAR_smash_cirno_desc: "Cirno is the direct opposite of Eternity - Larva represents summer, Cirno represents winter; Larva tries to develop, Cirno stagnates. Still, she is a fairy and as such it is only right to give her a place within our realm. However, the fight won't be easy as this ice brain managed to get herself enslaved by the Scarlet Devil..."
 LAR_face_okina_title: "Face Okina"
 LAR_face_okina_desc: "Between Eternity Larva and Okina Matara there is no deep connection - at least from Eternity's side. However, Okina claims that our good fairy mistress is the weaker form of an old rival of hers: Tokoyo no Kami, God of the Everlasting Night. While we are not quite sure just yet if her claims have any truth or not, her precense and her actions against fairy kind speaks for a war against her before she turns our people to stone too!"
 LAR_smash_marisa_title: "Witches of the Forest"
 LAR_smash_marisa_desc: "In the Forest of Magic live a lot of magicians and witches, led by the witch Marisa Kirisame, who is responsible for the death of many fairies of the past.

 LAR_consolidate_the_forest_title: "The Great Fairy Forest"
 LAR_consolidate_the_forest_desc: "Many of our kind fight their petty Fairy Wars, get wasted by some investigators or flee to the Outworld.

We don't run away anymore, we don't fight against eachother anymore; we reclaim together the great forests and restore the glory of fairy kind - and our good Eternity Larva will be the figure head of this ambition!"
 LAR_form_empire_title: "Eternal Fairy Empire"
 LAR_form_empire_desc: "The fairies of [Root.GetName] are peaceful people and we don't seek conquest like the others in Gensokyo. But sometimes, being nice just isn't enough and as such we need to make our realm to a true empire so others will fear us instead of seeing us as prey!"
 LAR_fairy_shrines_title: "The many Eternal Shrines"
 LAR_fairy_shrines_desc: "Due to the rumors of Eternity Larva's origins, our people has a way deeper connections to religion and the gods In order for our people to live their religious needs out we need more shrines in our realm. A LOT more shrines."
 LAR_master_weather_control_title: "Weather Master"
 LAR_master_weather_control_desc: "A strange Hell Fairy once came to Eternity Larva and gave her a torch. It was Clownpiece and the torch was supposed to cause madness, but in the hands of Eternity Larva, the torch caused a sudden change of the weather and made it better! Clownpiece may have left us and the torch is gone with her, but the weather power still is part of Eternity. All she has to do now is to master it!"
 LAR_master_weather_control_ct: "Any ally or subject, which is currently at war, has been target of the diplomatic action §YFluttering Summer§!."

 LAR_try_new_powers_out_desc: "As a fairy, who got the power of the Torch of Clownpiece, Eternity Larva was already astonishing. But now as a goddess there's no telling what possible strength she could have! All what is required for her is testing her ability out and see what will happen."
 LAR_try_new_powers_out_ct: "Are ally or subject of [Root.GetName], are in war and have been target of the diplomatic action §YFluttering Summer§!."
 LAR_try_new_powers_out_tt: "The Diplomatic Action §YFluttering Summer§! grants us also following modifier:"
 LAR_orange_flower_field_title: "The Orange Flower"
 LAR_orange_flower_field_desc: "According to ancient Japanese legends, an envoy of the Tenno went to to the Land of Eternal Night to bring Tokoyo no Kami an Orange Flower as sign of good will. Now if Okina, Hina and the Akis are right that our mistress is indeed a goddess, than this event must have happened here in Gensokyo, the only dream world. Keine mentioned that the mayor of the Human Capital possesses the only Orange Flower, which comes from Japan. We should take it and see what happens."
 LAR_face_kasen_title: "Ther Hermit Sage"
 LAR_face_kasen_desc: "Kasen Ibaraki is one of the sages of Gensokyo and an important personality. Even thought her realm is quite small compared to the other sages the real challenge is to impress her and make her acknowledge Eternity as a new Goddess of Gensokyo. Now, impressing her would usually require a danmaku fight or a feat of strength, but she wants it to make it easy on our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and just demands a renovation for her home."
 LAR_face_kasen_tt: "Kasen approves of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 LAR_kaguya_of_eternal_night_title: "Princess of Eternity"
 LAR_kaguya_of_eternal_night_desc: "When it comes to the theme of \"eternity\" there is really only one person, which is the princess from the moon: Kaguya Houraisan! If Eternity Larva's connection to any godhood is any true then the chance might be high that she lost her powers to Kaguya as both she and Tokoyo no Kami represent the Eternal Night! We should march into Eientei and ask her personally!"
 LAR_netherworld_of_eternal_night_title: "Restoring the Memories"
 LAR_netherworld_of_eternal_night_desc: "It is crystal clear now that these goddesses of Gensokyo are telling the truth and that Eternity Larva can be indeed the God of Eternal Night. However, as long our good mistress cannot remember this her claim of returning to godhood is iffy at best. Fortunately there is a way to restore the memory of a fairy which is by infusing her with the power of spirit itself. With the Snowspring Incident the evil demon tree has consumed much of the spring energy, but when Yuyuko got defeated the tree unleashed a good portion of this energy. Some of that energy though is still left and can be used for returning the memory Eternity once had."
 LAR_restore_godhood_title: "Restore Godhood"
 LAR_restore_godhood_desc: "The time has come! Eternity Larva managed to earn strong abilities, restored her memories and secured a safe home for her fairy kind. Now it is time for her to rise and reclaim the title \"Goddess\" again!"

 LAR_face_eiki_title: "Judge of the Yama"
 LAR_face_eiki_desc: "As a goddess, Eternity has now to prove her divinity to the important figures of Gensokyo. One of them is the Yamaxanadu Eiki Shiki, the great Judge of Gensokyo. Eiki doesn't care for the power a person has but the way how this power gets wielded. She acknowledges Eternity as a worth goddess when our people acknowledge her as a goddess too!"
 LAR_face_eiki_ct: "No owned province in Gensokyo has more than §Y2§! Unrest or §Y50§! Local Autonomy."

 LAR_face_yukari_title: "Overpower the Gap Hag"
 LAR_face_yukari_desc: "No youkai is more infamous than Yukari Yakumo, one of the big sages of Gensokyo. If Eternity hopes to be recognized as a goddess, she needs Yukari's approval. Unfortunately, Yukari is a very sleepy youkai and the only real way to wake her up is my knocking on her door... preferrebly with cannons."
 LAR_face_yukari_tt: "Yukari is too tired to object [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 LAR_face_reimu_title: "Defeat the Fairy Bully"
 LAR_face_reimu_desc: "Although she is just a human, she is one of the most influencial and powerful beings on Gensokyo: Reimu Hakurei, also know within the fairies as the Big Bully. Even as a goddess, Eternity prefers to solve problems peacefully, but sometimes peace was never an option as Reimu Hakurei will only acknowledge Eternity Larva when she defeats Reimu in a Danmaku Duel or when we have her shrine in our hands."
 LAR_face_reimu_tt: "Reimu still is angry about [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 LAR_build_a_navy_title: "Eternal Navy"
 LAR_build_a_navy_desc: "After we have now access to the sea we can finally build our precense on the sea. We should create a strong navy to protect our realm from all mean enemies, who try to invade us by sea!"
 LAR_explore_the_pacific_title: "Barrier Adé!"
 LAR_explore_the_pacific_desc: "The Hakurei Barrier has been broken apparently and Gensokyo is open to the outworld! Even if we have big ambitions within Gensokyo, we should ignore the chance to explore the outworld and see what might awaits us!"
 LAR_explore_the_west_title: "Exotic Continent"
 LAR_explore_the_west_desc: "Far in the west there should be a very exotic continent with strange animals and very unique cultures. It is in our curious nature to look what is going on there and see the things with our very own eyes!"

 LAR_face_lunarians_title: "Lunarian Threat"
 LAR_face_lunarians_desc: "As a fairy, Eternity Larva could not remember who or what was the reason that she lost her powers in the first place, but now as a goddess it is coming to her again. The lunarians experimented with the powers of the night and the moon and caused a magical feedback loop in the hope to find Eirin and Kaguya easier in Gensokyo. In the process they made Tokoyo no Kami's abilities inaccessible and turned Eternity Larva into the fairy we once knew.\nIt is clear that these lunarians are a threat and as such we need to eliminate them once and for all!"
 LAR_face_lunarians_tt: "Everyone liked that."
 LAR_colonizing_power_title: "Colonize the Outworld"
 LAR_colonizing_power_desc: "Exploring is fine and dandy, but we should go a step further and build our own colonies - and we will do it in moderation. Unlike certain spring fanatic fairies or want-to-be pirates, our focus will still remain on Gensokyo. Just a few colonies will help us out."

 ###EVENT FOR ETERNITY GARDEN###
 flavor_lar.1.t: "The Potential of Eternity Larva"
 flavor_lar.1.desc: "After our march into the Youkai Forest and the militaristic victory against Hina and the Aki sisters, Eternity Larva took a rest in the Shrine of Harvest. While glaring at the Misty Lake, the three defeated goddesses approached the young fairy. Even though they were former enemies, the Aki sisters nor Hina are goddesses who clinge to grudge. Instead they talked with our good mistress and felt something suspicious with her: they claim that Eternity Larvy might be indeed more than just a fairy, if not even a goddess, confirming the claim Okina made a long time ago! Eternity can't really believe what they say and continued glacing at the Misty Lake long after they have left her again..."
 flavor_lar.1.a: "How should I know if they are right?"
 flavor_lar.2.t: "The Orange Flower"
 flavor_lar.2.desc: "When Eternity Larva took the flower for herself she had a strange feeling. The flower disintegrated in her hand, but it in a beautiful glimmer. Apparently, it was indeed the very flower Eternity received centuries ago from the humans, worshipping her when she was a goddess and now this flower transferred its power to Eternity!"
 flavor_lar.2.a: "I'm still worthy!"
 flavor_lar.3.t: "The Butterflies of Gensokyo"
 flavor_lar.3.desc: "The cherry blossoms of Netherworld are swirling in the wind when Eternity arrived at the foot of the demon tree Saigyou Ayakashi. Without her noticing, Yuyuko Saigyouji, the mistress of Netherworld, appeared behind Eternity Larva and asked her if Eternity likes the cherry blossoms of this realm. She then noted that she too lost her memory of who she was before she became the ghost lady she is today. When Yuyuko tried to gather the spirit energy for finding out more about her past she of course didn't calculate the threat she posed for Gensokyo and she still feels sorry for it.\nHours have passed and both Yuyuko and Eternity found more parallels like their connection to butterflies. In the end, Yuyuko's daily duties have called for her, but before she vanished she casted a spell on the tree, which transfers some of the remaining spring energy to Eternity Larva, granting her access to the memories she once had as the god Tokoyo no Kami."
 flavor_lar.3.a: "Thank you, Lady Yuyuko!"
 flavor_lar.4.t: "The Claims against Kaguya"
 flavor_lar.4.desc: "Eternity Larva is known for her kindness and friendliness, but when it comes to her entrance she is as elegant and friendly as a fairy can be: marching into the house of a stranger like an elephant visiting the Chinaware store and throwing bunch of claims against Kaguya's head. The princess, completely shocked and puzzled of what was just happening required ten seconds before she was able to react to the claims of Eternity with a loud \"What?!\"...\nAfter a rather painful danmaku fight for Eternity, the situation has been de-escalated and Kaguya explains to our good mistress, that she has no idea of what the reason could be for Eternity's loss of power. Eternity felt more than bad for what she has done, but Kaguya was in a good mood, so she let Eirin make a potion, which should strengthen Eternity's current powers - even though it doesn't restore her godhood."
 flavor_lar.4.a: "I am so sorry again, Lady Kaguya!"
 flavor_lar.5.t: "Rebirth of Tokoyo no Kami!"
 flavor_lar.5.desc: "Eternity Larva went for the day into her chambers and slept in a cocoon made out of the finest silk our people could find for her. According to her this process is completely unnecessary, but she felt like it fits the most as her appearance in Gensokyo so far was the one of a fairy with butterfly wings. At the next day, Eternity has awakened and broke out of her cocoon. Instead of a fairy who looked like a girl around the age of eight, there was now a fully grown woman with butterfly wings larger than even the already impressive batwings of the Scarlet Devil.\nAlthough her name is now Tokoyo no Kami, the new goddess still prefers to be called by her fairy name Eternity Larva."
 flavor_lar.5.a: "I never thought I would grow up this way."
 ###MISSIONS FOR TFR###
 TFR_the_fairy_wars_title: "The Fairy Wars"
 TFR_the_fairy_wars_desc: "The three glorious fairies, our rulers Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire, once tried to unite the fairies, but Cirno has seen it as a decleration of war and fought against our just rulers.

 TFR_gather_power_title: "Grow in Power"
 TFR_gather_power_desc: "The unification of our kind is almost done. The only fairy remaining is Cirno.

 TFR_liberate_cirno_desc: "Although the Three Fairies and Cirno have a long and rather violent history, it is no secret that Cirno wants freedom from the Scarlet Devil and is ready to side with us. We should give her the chance to redeem herself and liberate her against the evil Remilia Scarlet!"

Reimu was always annoying to deal with and her shrine looks dumb, so Sunny has decided to make a plan which is nuking the shrine! However, building bombs isn't the usual skill a fairy has, so we will need the assistance of those humans or kappas... or rather their plans.\nWith Sunny's special abilities, the fairy spies can steal the plans from Kappapolis or from Rika's Place and we can build our own bomb!"
 TFR_prepare_the_bomb_tt: "Either owner of Kappapolis or Rika's Place has been pranked by [Root.GetName] with the §YFatal Flash Prank§! OR we own or have a subject own Kappapolis or Rika's Place."

This changed though when Star came to her with a rather upset face and told her about what she has experienced in the Human Capital. From personal experience, Kaguya knows too well how creepy humans can be and decided to not have any grudges against Star anymore.

As she looked at the Misty Sea she suddenly got an idea!\nLuna remembers that the humans published a book about from famous pirates of the island called \"Tsushima\". These pirates had only to worry about their own fun and weren't forced to think too much - perfect for a fairy culture based on pranks and stealing!
