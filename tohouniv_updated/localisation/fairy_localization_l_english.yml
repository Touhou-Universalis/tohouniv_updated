 FOM_byakurens_magic_desc: "Byakuren Hijiri might be a devout monk, but she is also a magician and was trained by Shinki herself! However, she refuses to join us in our ambition to create a magician academy as she sees herself as the leader of the Buddhistic faith first. Fortunately for us, the magical scrolls she got from Shinki are within the Myouren Temple. If we give her a great donation she might be convinced to give them to us.\nAlternatively, we could search them for ourself if we \"borrow\" some land of her realm."

 FOM_peace_between_witches_and_foresters_desc: "While our realm is ruled by the magicians, a great portion of our country is resident of youkais, who are too powerless to rule a nation on their own. Because of that magicians and youkais have to share the forest - and not all youkais are happy with that. We should improve the relations between magicians and youkais."

 FOM_rumia_of_the_forest_desc: "Rumia's eating behaviour caused serious issues with our human neighbours - and our magicians agree that this can't last any longer. If we don't want a massive human army invading the forest of magic we need to teach Rumia that a less humanoid diet is better for her. Instead she should enjoy the sweet taste of honey and sugar from the Land of the Back Door."

They claim that under the supervision of us magicians the youkais are living a so much better life. While Marisa is skeptical that the other youkais would be fond of becoming part of our great realm, she can't decline this wish. Especially since a unified, Grand Forest of Magic means easier access to rare magical ingredients."
 ###FOM FLAVOR EVENTS###
 flavor_fom.5.t: "Patchouli's Interest"
 flavor_fom.5.desc: "Our marketing strategy did not take long to get us the attention of several mages of Gensokyo. The most surprising one however is Patchouli herself, who has decided to leave the library for once and to check out what is going on here. When she realized, that Marisa and Alice were fond of Patchouli's rather random idea of a school for magic, she decided to join us as an advisor for our mistresses and as the librarian for the academy!"
 flavor_fom.5.a: "Glad to see her on board now!"
 fom_can_hire_patchouli_now_tt: "We can now hire Patchouli via a decision!"
 flavor_fom.6.t: "Ellen's Second Business"
 flavor_fom.6.desc: "Long, blonde hair. Red and white witch outfit and a bow instead of the classic hat. Marisa has heard it often that the visual similarities between her and Ellen are quite obvious. However, the personalities are clearly different.\nEllen is quite childish and spontanous.\nStill, when it comes to business she beats Marisa as she has announced that her new home, the place which we used to call part of the Youkai Trail, will also become her second shop in Gensokyo.... or rather her cat's shop as she will be busy with teaching young witches and magicians about the Art of the Merchant."
 flavor_fom.6.a: "She is quite the ... special ... witch."
 flavor_fom.7.t: "The Jizou Statues"
 flavor_fom.7.desc: "Narumi is not a natural born magician nor was she ever a human. She was once a lifeless Jizou statue, which purpose was to guide the deceased young. However when she became sentient her role has shifted: she is no longer guiding the dead but creating the statues, who does the job for her now. With her ability of affecting life she is a valuable teacher for the school of Alteration Magic and a spiritual guide for our realm."
 flavor_fom.8.t: "Scrolls of the Myouren Temple"
 flavor_fom.8.desc: "We have gained three magical scrolls from the Myouren Temple. However, they are sealed with a special spell, which can be only broken with a special designed key.

 flavor_fom.10.t: "Gensokyo's Academy of Magic"

 flavor_fom.12.desc.b: "Mai and Yuki are Lady Shinki's personal court witches and masters of the elements of Frost and Fire. They might serve Shinki, but due to Alice's birth right as the Daughter of Makai they have an oath to serve Alice as much as they do it for the goddess.\nHowever, [Root.Monarch.GetName] confronted the two witches and reminded them of their oath, of which they replied that they will only hear [Root.Monarch.GetName] when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] defeats them in a traditional Danmaku Duel!"

 flavor_fom.16.t: "From Meat to Sugar"
 flavor_fom.16.desc: "It took a while, but after Rumia has tasted the sweetness of sugar and honey in the Back Door's Realm she fully \"converted\" to a much sweeter diet - and due to her youkai physiology the sugar does not have a negative effect on her body either.\nWhen the humans of Gensokyo heard of this news they celebrated [Root.Monarch.GetName] for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] banishment of the Rumia threat."
 flavor_fom.16.a: "Well, what can i say, except you're welcome."

 HKR_genji_the_turtle_title: "Genjii needs Healing"
 HKR_genji_the_turtle_desc: "Despite his age and his ... turtle being ... Genjii is a powerful defender of the Shrine and served Reimu as a flying device before she learnt to fly on her own. Because of that service, Genjii suffers heavy back pain and is currently basically useless. He needs some healing before he can help us out yet again.\nFortunately, there is a healing ingredient in the Spring Path. If we get on good terms with its owner we might heal Genjii from his severe back pain."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_title: "Goddess of Poverty"
 HKR_harness_shions_power_desc: "There are many gods in Gensokyo, but none is as costly to house as Shion Yorigami, the goddess of poverty. And because of her powers she causes a lot of bad luck to all the people around her... except for Tenshi. While Reimu often played with the idea of banishing her from the Shrine, Heavenly Realm will not take her either.\nLuckily Reimu had an idea: harnassing the power of Shion in the Shrine's favor. And to test the weaponized poverty out we should unleash her misfortune on one of our rivals."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_tt: "A §Yrandom rival nation§!, who has been insulted and spied by us, will §Ysuffer a massive financial hit§!. (Is a lot less effective against rival players.)"
 HKR_please_aunn_title: "A Gift for Aunn"
 HKR_please_aunn_desc: "Aunn Komano is the secret guardian of all devine places - especially the Hakurei Shrine. Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstandment she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn. Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_title: "Study the Origins"
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo. Our shrine maiden Reimu has no problems to remember, but even then she needs a person of history and religion to remind her to meditate about the past and to reflect."
 HKR_touhou_2_title: "Marsh on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just marsh into Reimaden ourself and take the orbs from Mima."
 HKR_touhou_3_title: "The Okazaki Reform"
 HKR_touhou_3_desc: "Back in the days when our realm was still in the North, we had contact with people, who claim to be from the future. Their leader is a Professor called Yumemi Okazaki. Despite the issues she has caused for Reimu, the technology and the ideas of stress management helped her significantly.\nBut times have changed and with that the memories of Okazaki's reforms. We should try to get in contact with the Probability Space Hypervessel again."
 HKR_touhou_4_title: "Re-Acquire the Dream Lotus"
 HKR_touhou_4_desc: "Reimu collected special dream items during the Lotus Land Story Incident, which she later used to defeat Yuuka. Although Reimu has lost this artifact it is lost in time. All we have to do is convincing Yuuka to give it back to Reimu..."
 HKR_touhou_5_title: "Journey to Makai"
 HKR_touhou_5_desc: "After meditating and acquire so many artifacts from the time of the Hakurei Tradition, Reimu has decided to visit the place of her last battle before the great Spell Card reform: to Makai!\nEven though the relationship between Shinki and Reimu is a lot better now, the scars of the near-death experience in Makai still exist."

 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_title: "[Root.GetName] and the Estates"
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_desc: "Usually, the goal of an absolute ruler is to control all of the crownland for themselves and being the head for all decisions of the state. But these are not usual times here in Gensokyo. Due to the curse of the Donation Box collecting of donations has proven pointless anyway. So instead we should focus on earning some money by selling the crownland."
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_tt: "If we decide to sell crown land to the estates we will get '§YRevoked Donations§!' for §Y40 years§!, giving the following effects:\nMonthly Autonomy Change: §G-0.40§!\nLiberty Desire from Subjects Development: §G-150.0%§!\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\n\nOtherwise we will get '§YDonations for the Estates§!' for §Y40 years§!, giving the following effects:\nNational Tax Modifier: §G+20.0%§!\nShrine Maidens Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\nYoukais Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\nMerchant Guilds Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!"
 HKR_build_connections_title: "Build Connections"
 HKR_build_connections_desc: "It is no secret that our realm is not particularily in a good financial spot. Donations are vanishing, economical position is weak and we are surrounded by potential enemies meaning there is hardly an expansion opportunity for more money. To solve this issue we need to focus on alternative sources of income. We should build some connections with the local shrine maidens. Maybe they know of some jobs for us."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_title: "Youkai Exterminator"
 HKR_youkai_hunter_desc: "Our shrine maidens have reported that some youkais were going mad lately near Human Capital. Usually Byakuren or Keine would take care of them, but they have been busy too lately, so the job is now ours to do. But at least we got a good payment promised from the humans."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_tt: "Either own the provinces §YHuman Capital§!, §YLingering Snow Road§! and §YTewi's Rabbit Hole§! or exterminated mindless youkais for their province owners with the '§YExterminate Wild Youkais§!' diplomatic action."
 HKR_explore_east_pacific_title: "Explore the Pacific"
 HKR_explore_east_pacific_desc: "The Barrier is lost and it is uncertain if we will ever manage to restore it to protect Gensokyo. However, we shouldn't grief about the lost and instead try to make the best out of it. Rumors tell that in the far east there might be some valuable gold and silver sources - and pure gold and silver do not vanish like donations. We should explore the sea beyond."
 HKR_explore_east_pacific_tt: "Discover §YEastern Polynesia§!."
 HKR_colonize_south_america_title: "Settle in the Andes"
 HKR_colonize_south_america_desc: "Apparently the rumors are true: there IS land in the far east! We should settle there and see if the stories about gold and silver are true though."
 HKR_incas_gold_title: "Wealth of the Incas"
 HKR_incas_gold_desc: "The new land in the east is filled with exotic food, new animals and strange youkais. But most noteworthy are the gold and silver sources. There is even a whole mountain filled with silver, which resources are are ready to be exploited for the donation box! All we need to do is taking it!"

 flavor_hkr.8.t: "Weaponized Poverty"
 flavor_hkr.8.desc: "It was not easy but after some convining, Reimu managed to send Shion to our rival to pay them a little visit. Just how our Shrine Maiden expected, Shion's precense caused for a massive financial crisis in there!\nHowever, Shion noted that she prefers to not be used like that in the future and wants to help us by making loan sharks go bankrupt instead."
 flavor_hkr.8.a: "Don't forget the normal bank neither, Shion."
 flavor_hkr.9.t: "Shion's Visit"
 flavor_hkr.9.desc: "Usually it is a good sign when a god visits the throne of a country. But not today! [Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury. When the Shion incident happened, the guard noticed where our precious gold went and collected it all for our realm. Because of that he gets a gift of 10 Ducats."
 flavor_hkr.25.t: "Part 0: Origin of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hkr.25.desc: "A long time ago youkais and humans lived side by side on the normal world in a symbiotic relationship as Youkais nourish on the human emotions and faith while the humans profit from the youkai by using their powers for humankind. However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkais. However, the youkais needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."
 flavor_hkr.25.a: "Yeah ok, nice origin story for the continent, but what about the Hakurei Clan?"
 flavor_hkr.26.t: "Part 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers"
 flavor_hkr.26.desc: "Originally, our country has been a clan of shrine maidens and guardians from Japan. A role, which we now fulfill in Gensokyo today too. But our current position in Gensokyo wasn't always our home. Before that we lived in the high north of Gensokyo until the early incidents, which were investigated by Reimu Hakurei.\n\nThe first incident was about about the sudden destruction of the Hakurei Shrine, the heart of our realm. The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell. After several bloody battles and the first encounter with Mima, Reimu managed to defeat Konngara with the power of the unstable Yin-Yang Orbs. Not much is known about this incident later on though and only Konngara and Mima might know more from it."
 flavor_hkr.26.a: "These were weird times."
 flavor_hkr.26.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Konngara and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."

 flavor_hkr.261.desc: "A girl in red samurai clothes with a fine katana and a long horn on her forehead - this is the visual memory Reimu has of Konngara, the Astral Knight. Nowadays, Konngara is enjoying a calm life in the remains of Hell's oldest location, the Silent Temple. However, back then she was the culprit of the first destruction of the Old Hakurei Shrine and got confronted by Reimu."
 flavor_hkr.261.a: "I remember she didn't say a single word..."
 flavor_hkr.261.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger the memory of a fight between the Konngara and Reimu!§!"

 flavor_hkr.27.desc: "After the events of the \"High Responsive Prayer\" Incident the shrine enjoyed some time of peace. But this only remained for a short duration as one day the shrine was invaded by hellish monsters of unknown origin. As exterminating these monsters did not stop them from returning, Reimu decided to visit the Old Hell again. During her journey she encountered and defeated the Engineer Rika and the the Samurai Meira.\n\nWhen Reimu entered the realm of Reimaden a young witch tried to stop her. It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw eachother as enemies and could not stand eachother. However, after Marisa's and Mima's unavoidable defeat, Marisa decided to leave Reimaden to discover the wonders of Gensokyo on her own..."

 flavor_hkr.271.t: "Memory of Mima, the Evil Spirit"
 flavor_hkr.271.desc: "No ghost is as infamous as Mima is within Gensokyo. There have been rumors that she will come back and that her return will mean the end of Gensokyo. Reimu remembers the chaos that Mima has caused back in the days with her summoning of hellish creatures within the Hakurei Shrine - and Reimu had enough of that. When she confronted Mima in Reimaden it came to an epic battle between these two."
 flavor_hkr.271.a: "Good griefs... I don't want to think back to her Twilight Spark..."

 flavor_hkr.28.desc: "Following the \"Eastern Wonderland Stories\" Incident the shrine maiden found one day curious ruins not far from the Hakurei Shrine. As rumors of wishfulfilling being have reached the rest of Gensokyan many people traveled to the Fantasy Ruins to harness the power for themselves.

One of those persons was Marisa again and while these two were enemies on battle they started to have sympathy to eachother."

 flavor_hkr.281.t: "Memory of Professor Yumemi Okazaki"
 flavor_hkr.281.desc: "Not much is known about the ones, who call themselves \"Time Traveler\" other than that they do their name justice. Although they are a mystery for the usual Gensokyan, Reimu can remember when Yumemi Okazaki, the leader of the Time Travelers, crashed into the Back Mountain. In order to hide themselves, they disguised their \"ship\" as ruins. However, Yumemi's assistant, Chiyuri, had to spread a rumor of a genie in the Fantasy Ruins, which eventually lead to Reimu facing off Yumemi."
 flavor_hkr.281.a: "Ah yes. I won my own personal maid on this day."

When Reimu tried to finally relax the Hakurei Shrine got invaded by dozens and dozens of youkais. She and her former enemy and now good friend Marisa were more than annoyed by the sheer influx of new youkais. They went out to seal the source of these new youkais, which led them eventually to Mugenkan, the mansion of Yuuka Kazami.

Reimu Hakurei was exhausted, but she could not let these demons stay in Gensokyo. So the young shrine maiden traveled to Makai, followed by Marisa, Mima and Yuuka. On her journey she saw how powerful demons surpressed youkais and how danmakus are used against inobedient fairies.

Nobody in Gensokyo was as difficult and dangerous to defeat for Reimu than Shinki - especially since there was no security during a Danmaku Duel back then. The fight against Shinki was one to life and death for herself. One she luckily won."
 flavor_hkr.301.a: "Fortunately, Shinki is a nowadays a lot calmer."
 flavor_hkr.301.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger the memory of a fight between the Shinki and Reimu!§!"
 flavor_hkr.31.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.31.desc: "Reimu returned after her final battle against Shinki to the Old Hakurei Shrine - or that what was remaining of it. Our old realm, her home, has been completely destroyed. All what is left are the foundations of the shrine and the donation box. After minutes which felt like hours of grief, the silence has been broken by the arrival of a person. She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkais and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her. She led the survivors of our people to the South of Gensokyo to rebuild the Clan and the Shrine there."
 flavor_hkr.31.a: "What happens next?"
 flavor_hkr.32.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.32.desc: "In the mean time a new power has entered Gensokyo's stage: Scarlet Realm, led by the vampire Remilia Scarlet. Remilia brought spells and powers from the far west, which were exceeding anything before in raw spell power. After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."
 flavor_hkr.32.a: "Go on."
 flavor_hkr.33.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.33.desc: "Reimu then trained several new shrine maidens in the teachings of youkai extermination, danmaku battles and the new Spell Card System. She managed to convert many people - be it youkais or humans - to Hakurei Shintoism, teaching them to stick to the Spell Card rules. It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has beed spreaded from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of shintoism and fighting. This movement later became the \"Hakurei Tradition\"."
 flavor_hkr.33.a: "And what about those, who were left in the North?"
 flavor_hkr.34.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.34.desc: "While all that was happening, Marisa Kirisame decided to move away too. During her journey in Makai she found a new colleague: Alice Margatroid. Despite their differences and conflicts they became good friends. They turned their back to North Gensokyo when they heard about Reimu and her implementing the Spell Card System in Gensokyo and decided to settle in the Forest of Magic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mima tried to become a god on her own, but got bored eventually and returned to Reimaden. It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."

 flavor_hkr.100.desc: "After reflecting the last fight in her memories, Reimu remembered one of the few hidden gold cashes in Old Hakurei Shrine. She sent some undercover shrine maidens to acquire the lost treasures for the realm."
 flavor_hkr.100.a: "Who knew meditation could be that profitable."
 flavor_hkr.101.t: "The Pain of Danmakus"
 flavor_hkr.101.desc: "Despite it being just a pure memory, the pain from remembering the last, lost danmaku battle still burns. Due to the deep connection between the Hakurei Shrine and the Shrine Maiden's spirit, [Root.Monarch.GetName] feels the pain too like it is real."

 flavor_cin.1.desc: "It is done! Our realm managed to throw the Scarlet shackles away and it is now time to forge our own destiny - and [Root.Monarch.GetName] already has an idea what it will be about: the liberation of other fairies, which are slaves! While this goal is very honorable, many fairies don't know how we should treat the oppressors when we turn the tables and integrate them into our realm. Half of the fairies cry for vengeance for the crimes against the fairy-kind while the other half demands of us to be better than the oppressors.\nIn the end, only the strongest fairy - [Root.Monarch.GetName] - can decide for [Root.GetName]..."
 flavor_cin.1.a: "We can't live in the past. We shall treat them just as good as our people!"
 flavor_cin.1.a.tt: "Take the §YPath of Forgiveness§!."

 flavor_cin.2.t: "The Powers of Winter"
 flavor_cin.2.desc: "It took quite some time for Cirno to find her, but in the end after doing several successful pranks she finally managed to learn where Letty was hiding. When Cirno confronted Letty, she was at first reluctant to even talk with Cirno. But after a quick presentation of the abilities of her abilities (and enough annoying), Letty gave in and taught Cirno a new technique to cast even more severe Hailstorms."
 flavor_cin.2.a: "Thank you Letty!"

 flavor_cin.3.t: "Fight for the title \"[Root.GetMonarchTitle] of all Fairies\""
 flavor_cin.3.desc: "For a long time the fairies of Gensokyo were an unorganized bunch of spirits of nature with their leader being the one, who is supposed to be the strongest. A true title of King or of Queen never existed before - until now. The day when [Root.Monarch.GetName] crowned [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] was the day when many other fairies from the other realms claimed, that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has no right to be a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the first place.\nTo avoid another fairy war, which was triggered by the Three Fairies, Daiyousei suggested a challenge for all fairies to show their worth as [Root.GetMonarchTitle] of all fairies - the Royal Fairy Challenge has been born! A series of tasks, challenges, pranks and duels, which shall show who is the Strongest, Wisest and Quickest Fairy of Gensokyo!"
 flavor_cin.3.a: "I will show them all, that I am indeed the Strongest!"
 flavor_cin.4.t: "The Prosecution of Reimu Hakurei"
 flavor_cin.4.desc: "It looks rather simple, made out of wood and ice, but it does look impressive on its Fairy way. The courthouse of the Fairies is rather simple but it does its job - and today it shall house the lawsuit against the greatest criminal against the fairy rights: Reimu Hakurei! It didn't take long for the jury to make their judgement: GUILTY!\nNow it is to Daiyousei, the most clever fairy in [Root.GetName] to make the final judgement and the kind of punishment..."
 flavor_cin.4.a: "Throw her into the prison!"
 flavor_cin.4.a.tt: "Every §Yally of Hakurei Clan§! or §YHakurei Shinto§! nation will see this act as an attack against the safety of Gensokyo and will gain §R15§! Aggressive Expansion against us!"
 flavor_cin.4.b: "She shall repay the fairy lifes in Ducats!"
 flavor_cin.4.c: "She shall swear to protect un in the future!"
 flavor_cin.4.c.tt: "Many fairies will see this as treason against the fairy rights!"
 flavor_cin.5.t: "Reimu Hakurei's Guilt"
 flavor_cin.5.desc: "The fairies of [From.GetName] have spoken and claim Reimu to be guilty! Now they want to imprison the current leader of the Hakurei Shrine in a fairy prison!"
 flavor_cin.5.a: "I won't bow before a bunch of idiots!"
 flavor_cin.5.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a Danmaku fight between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the fairy prison guard!§!"
 flavor_cin.5.b: "I just see this as some vacations for me."
 flavor_cin.5.b.tt: "A close friend will do the bussiness in [Root.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] will still be treated as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] though - even out of the prison."
 flavor_cin.7.t: "Prison Break - A full Success!"
 flavor_cin.7.desc: "The fairy guards were no challenge for [Root.Monarch.GetName] and now [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is free from the fairy oppression!"
 flavor_cin.7.a: "That was easy."
 flavor_cin.8.t: "Prison Break - A complete Failure!"
 flavor_cin.8.desc: "To [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s surprise, the fairies are actually competent and managed to stop the prison break."
 flavor_cin.8.a: "*Sigh*"
 flavor_cin.9.t: "The Leader of the Hakurei Clan breaks out!"
 flavor_cin.9.desc: "The guilty mass murderer of many fairies is on loose feet again and many fairies are worrying for their life!"
 flavor_cin.9.a: "Oh no..."
 flavor_cin.10.t: "Attempted Prison Break"
 flavor_cin.10.desc: "The evil shrine maiden, who commited several crimes against the fairies, tried today a prison break. Fortunately, the fairy guards are more than competent and managed to beat her back!"
 flavor_cin.10.a: "Good. We don't want her to be free again soon!"
 flavor_cin.11.t: "Keine's lessons"
 flavor_cin.11.desc: "Keine is the history teacher and guardian of the Human Capital. She is known for her abilities of \"eating\" and \"creating\" history but also for her good teaching skills.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] used to visit her course, but she was always Keine's poorest student. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] returned to her home and freed her people, she captured the Human Capital. Keine couldn't believe how much her \"most stupid student ever\" has improved herself so much. Keine now offers a special, fairy-friendly lecture for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to improve her learning skills a last time or a course for our advisors to make them less stupid. Which offer will our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] take?"
 flavor_cin.11.desc.nc: "Keine is the history teacher and guardian of the Human Capital. She is known for her abilities of \"eating\" and \"creating\" history but also for her good teaching skills.\nCirno, founder of Cirnia, used to visit her course, but she was always Keine's poorest student. After Cirno returned to her home and freed her people her people, she captured the Human Capital. Keine couldn't believe how much her \"most stupid student ever\" has improved herself so much. Keine now offers a special, fairy-friendly lecture for Cirno, but she is currently busy, which is why [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets now this offer. The teacher also has a course for our advisors to make them less stupid. Which offer will our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] take?"
 flavor_cin.11.a: "Well... if her lesson will make me better than I will sure take it."
 flavor_cin.11.b: "I don't need a lesson from a bully! She should teach my advisors instead."
 flavor_cin.12.t: "Eirin's drug"
 flavor_cin.12.desc: "Eirin is more or less the doctor for Gensokyo. She made many medications to heal diseases but also drugs, which enhance its user. Our fairy troops found a special drug called \"Peerless Patriot's Elixir\" which increases the speaking skills for a fairy (or at least they think so). This elixir could definitely make [Root.Monarch.GetName] a stronger ruler, or she could give this potion to her replaceable diplomats..."
 flavor_cin.12.a: "Stronger you say? I'll drink it in one go!"
 flavor_cin.12.b: "I would rather be eaten by a Giant Toad than to drink this potion. Give it to some diplomats."
 flavor_cin.13.t: "Training with Mokou"
 flavor_cin.13.desc: "Fujiwara no Mokou is an odd one in Gensokyo. Mokou is completely immortal, a master of fire and threat for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but fortunately Mokou doesn't care too much about politics as long she has her peace.\nStill, somebody like Mokou would be the perfect training partner for a ice fairy like [Root.Monarch.GetName]. She could also train our soldiers instead. Which option will our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] choose?"
 flavor_cin.13.a: "Let's see how long a pyromaniac can be frozen in place!"
 flavor_cin.13.c: "Let's see what an immortal can do against fairy power!"
 flavor_cin.13.b: "Let the soldiers train with her. We all know she would be no challenge for me!"
 flavor_cin.14.t: "Fight with Suwako"
 flavor_cin.14.desc: "As our fairies marched into Moriya land, they found Suwako Moriya, an ancient goddess and founder of Moriya Shintoism. Although she never had any direct connection to frogs it is clear that she likes these animals. She even chose a frog as her spirit form.\nOn the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] loves to freeze any frogs she encounters. She did it so much that one day, a giant toad decided to eat [Root.Monarch.GetName] to take revenge for the frozen frogs. [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to escape, but she didn't learn her lesson and is still freezing frogs - which Suwako doesn't like.\nAfter the annexation of the Moriya Shrine it isn't a surprise that Suwako challenges [Root.Monarch.GetName] to avenge the frogs."
 flavor_cin.14.desc.nc: "Suwako Moriya is an ancient goddess and founder of Moriya Shintoism. Although she never had any direct connection to frogs it is clear that she likes these animals. She even chose a frog as her spirit form.\nOn the other hand Cirno, the founder of our great nation, loves to freeze any frogs she encounters. She did it so much that someday a giant toad decided to eat Cirno to take revenge for the frozen frogs. Cirno managed to escape, but she didn't learn her lesson and is still freezing frogs - which Suwako doesn't like.\nAfter the annexation of the Moriya Shrine it isn't a surprise that Suwako wants to challenge Cirno to avenge the frogs. Unfortunately she only found [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It isn't clear if Suwako will fight [Root.Monarch.GetName] or if she settles it down..."
 flavor_cin.14.a: "Finally! A worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!"
 flavor_cin.14.b: "I think I could apologize for these frozen beasts..."
 flavor_cin.14.c: "I don't have time for a frog goddess. Shall the army fight her!"
 flavor_cin.14.d: "I will fight this goddess in Cirno's name!"
 flavor_cin.15.t: "Eiki's lecture"
 flavor_cin.15.desc: "Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu, judge of the dead, paid [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a visit. Eiki has visited [Root.Monarch.GetName] already once to tell her that [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s abilities exceed these of a normal fairy, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] didn't care... or better said: [Root.Monarch.GetName] didn't understand.\nAlthough Eiki isn't too happy about the fairy conquest of her realm she still keeps her habit of lecturing the people of Gensokyo - and today it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s turn for Eiki's lecture... again."
 flavor_cin.15.desc.nc: "Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu, judge of the dead, paid [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a visit. She visited once Cirno to tell her that her abilities exceed these of a normal fairy. Now she's here to talk with [Root.Monarch.GetName] and although Eiki isn't too happy about the fairy conquest of her realm she still keeps her habit of lecturing the people of Gensokyo. Perhaps she will tell [Root.Monarch.GetName] that her power is grown too..."
 flavor_cin.15.a: "Ok, this time I will try to follow her lecture."
 flavor_cin.15.a.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will try to improve [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] - even if it means listening to Eiki's lecture for hours."
 flavor_cin.15.b: "Here we go again..."
 flavor_cin.15.b.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will try to ignore Eiki and do office work instead. In the short term, this may be better than listening to the yama..."
 flavor_cin.15.c: "I am curious how powerful I might be..."
 flavor_cin.15.d: "Her lectures are boring! I'll try to ignore her..."
 flavor_cin.16.t: "Travel to Makai"
 flavor_cin.16.desc: "Makai is a strange location in Gensokyo. It is completely artificial and created by Shinki. It is also a very important place in Gensokyo. As we conquered this strange land we found a lot of fairies and freed them from there, but we also found native fairies there! These Makaian fairies could make excellent new friends for Cirnia. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] can travel to the World of Snow and Ice and try to absorb some of its power. The decision is hers..."
 flavor_cin.16.a: "New friends are always good."
 flavor_cin.16.b: "The power of the World of Ice and Snow is mine!"
 flavor_cin.16.c: "How about both?"
 flavor_cin.16.c.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will try to integrate the makaian fairies into our society and take a look at the World of Ice and Snow. Because [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has only limited time [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] won't learn much from the journey to Makai."
 flavor_cin.17.t: "Retribution against Sanae"
 flavor_cin.17.desc: "Apparently, this \"Sanae\" shrine maiden was indeed a new shrine maiden and not the imposter Reimu. Still, just like Reimu, Sanae too did many crimes against the fairies and shall pay for it. However, because the Moriya lands are far away from the Fairy Lands and because Sanae's crimes are less severe she got her punishment without a trial!"
 flavor_cin.17.a: "Freeze her like a frog!"
 flavor_cin.17.a.tt: "Every §Yally of Moriya Clan§! or §YMoriya Shinto§! nation will see this act as an attack against the safety of Gensokyo and will gain §R15§! Aggressive Expansion against us!"
 flavor_cin.17.b: "She will have to pay the fine!"
 flavor_cin.17.c: "She didn't too much bad against the fairies. We should let her go."
 flavor_cin.17.c.tt: "Fairies who are out for vengeance will see it as treason!"
 flavor_cin.18.t: "The insane punishment of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_cin.18.desc: "Wild fairies marched into the Moriya lands, set the shrine on fire and pulled [Root.Monarch.GetName] out of her own [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bed to punish for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crimes against fairy kind. Cirno herself then executed the punishment: a deep freeze against [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_cin.18.a: "Cold..."
 flavor_cin.18.b: "Miracles of Gensokyo, save me..."
 flavor_cin.19.t: "The Forest of Fairies"
 flavor_cin.19.desc: "It was once the home of all fairy kind - and now it has returned to the rightful owners! We are now the lords of the Forest of Magic and our people are ready to resettle the forest and making it into the fairy stronghold it once was. They only wait on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s command..."
 flavor_cin.19.a: "Restore the Forest to its former glory!"
 flavor_cin.19.b: "It is better if we develop [Root.Capital.GetName] instead."
 flavor_cin.20.t: "Preperation for Independence"
 flavor_cin.20.desc: "[Root.GetName] once ruled over the shores of the Misty Lake, but ever since the Scarlet Devil appeared our realm got pushed back. Eventually, Remilia decided to recruit us as her fairy maidens for the mansion. Of course this is slavery and Cirno and the other fairies rejected to serve her as maiden! But still, we ended up as a vassal.\nHowever, not all is lost! [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ideas to turn the tables and has prepared a plan for our independence!"
 flavor_cin.20.a: "We will get allies to help us!"
 flavor_cin.20.a.ct: "The diplomatic action '§YAsk to Support Independence§!' is enabled.\n(It should be part of the base game at this point...)"
 flavor_cin.20.a.tt: "Every country, who is independent or a Tributary, has their capital in Gensokyo and has an opinion of §Y125§! of us, will get the event '§Y[Root.GetName] asks for Support§!', which will ask them to support our independency."
 flavor_cin.20.b: "We will declare war on Remilia and fight for our freedom!"
 flavor_cin.20.c: "We will wait for Remilia to let us go peacefully!"
 flavor_cin.20.c.tt: "Spoiler alert: Remilia won't let you go peacefully..."
 flavor_cin.21.t: "[From.GetName] asks for Support"
 flavor_cin.21.desc: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] asks us for our support in their incoming war against the Scarlet Devil. It would mean a war with Remilia Scarlet for sure, but [From.Monarch.GetName] would appreciate it a lot if we help [From.GetName.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_cin.21.a: "Sure! The Scarlet Devil must fall!"
 flavor_cin.21.b: "I wouldn't get anything of value out of that war."
 flavor_cin.22.t: "Hellfairies' Fate"
 flavor_cin.22.desc: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] arrived at Clownpiece's base on the moon, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] saw what happened to her fellow fairies: the hellfairies got enchanted by Junko to make them into living weapons against the Lunarian - and Clownpiece stands triumphantly as their leader in front of them, not knowing that she sold her people and herself to Junko!\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is not known for cleverness and wisdom, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows when she sees crimes being done against other fairies - and this treachery is a prime example! And there is only one way to make Clownpiece pay for this!"
 flavor_cin.22.a: "BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA! BAKA!"
 flavor_cin.22.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Clownpiece and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!\nBecause [Root.Monarch.GetName] is incredibly mad [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gets §G+999§! §YDanmaku Power§! for this fight!"
 flavor_cin.24.t: "Clownpiece's Beatdown"
 flavor_cin.24.desc: "Cirno and Clownpiece had a long history of rivalry, but it never came down to an actual fight - until this day! In the first time of Fairy history a fight broke out, which takes more than 20 seconds to finish! During the long danmaku fight both fairies went out of magic to use any danmaku so they even started going into melee and fought the last five minutes with bare fists! In the end though, Cirno managed to beat Clownpiece and punched her often enough that Clownpiece capitulates!"
 flavor_cin.24.a: "You deserved it, Clownpiece! You sold your people to Hecatia, now you've paid the price!"
 flavor_cin.24.a.tt: "After this complete beatdown, Clownpiece decided to repent for her sins and swore to serve us as a general!"
 flavor_cin.25.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Beatdown"
 flavor_cin.25.desc: "The power of Hecatia is strong within Clownpiece and even though Cirno went berserk against her, she still was no match for the hell fairy. After 20 seconds of danmakus the fight is over - and Cirno lost."
 flavor_cin.25.a: "This ... really ... sucks..."
 flavor_cin.26.t: "Defeat of the Fairy Slayer"
 flavor_cin.26.desc: "Although the numbers of fairy kills is much higher for Reimu, Marisa, Sanae and Sakuya, none of them were as painful and efficient than Youmu Konpaku! This evil half-ghost does no know mercy in combat and as such we repaid these crimes against her! Although many fairies died in the battle again Youmu, in the end we managed to defeat her and imprison her! Now her fighting techniques will be taught to our troops while she enjoys watering some ice flowers!"
 flavor_cin.26.a: "Justice wins again!"
 flavor_cin.27.t: "Reconquest of the Scarlet Island"
 flavor_cin.27.desc: "The Scarlet Island was once part of the great Fairy nations of Gensokyo until one day a mysterious vampire appeared with a mansion and took the island for herself! Ever since we lost more and more foothold to a vampire, humans and magicians. But now, with the reconquest of our beloved island, we can now fully claim that things go better for Fairy kind!"
 flavor_cin.27.a: "It is time to bring the Fairies back to the island."
 flavor_cin.125.t: "The Art of War - Baka Edition"
 flavor_cin.125.desc: "Wars aren't unknown for fairies. A lot of our people fought and died for their slave masters. But they were mostly used like mercenaries and never had real training. [Root.Monarch.GetName] desires to change this and tries to make Cirinia's troops into a professional army. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacks the knowledge how to train, which means [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to experiment with the many training methods..."
 flavor_cin.125.a: "Well, let the soldiers fight against each other on top of a volcano to make them stronger!"
 flavor_cin.125.b: "A battle royale wasn't the best idea. How about they just drill together with a general?"
 flavor_cin.125.c: "They are already the strongest army in Gensokyo! We should hire more soldiers instead!"

But most of them are dominated by humans and youkais on the earth. As a result of inquiring into their location, we received reports that most of them live beyond the forest of magic next to the bamboo forest we control. Also, looks like this forest of magic is a land suitable for fairies to live in, and some fairies actually live in parts of the forest.

Because of that, Hecatia had no troubles with giving her favourite fairy more freedom.\nHowever, the question of religion was still open. [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't care too much about religions and our [Root.GovernmentName] follows the Lunarian faith because of convience with the locals. Hecatia made the offer to entrust her realm in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hands if we all convert to Hakurei Shintoism with her as the only deity.

 flavor_lil.1.desc: "We were right all along! There IS land and people out there. The strangers have already took a liking to our mistress! The moment we set foot on their land we found them wailing over their failed crops and harvests. After our mistress lily blessed them, they were very indebted. So indebted in fact, that they were ready to die for our mistress! Now they're begging us to rule and guide them. Not only this will elevate our ruler's status, but it'll make for a lovely homecoming story as well!"
 flavor_lil.2.a: "A new destiny awaits us!"
 flavor_lil.2.t: "New Beginnings"
 flavor_lil.2.desc: "Who would have thought, that a simple curiosity of a fairy would lead her into becoming a renowned ruler? Such is the destiny of our white herald. We shall perform our best to cater to our newfound lands and peoples! And we hope that if there are other people out there, they get to call us to deliver a swift and beautiful spring!"
 flavor_lil.3.a: "Truly we are blessed!"
 flavor_lil.3.t: "An unforeseen friendship"
 flavor_lil.3.desc: "On the verge of summer, while lily was planning on how to appease the Satoris, she got an invitation from the mistress of the underworld herself;Satori Komeiji. While this seemed strange at first, Satori explained that she has heard of Lily's ambitions to search for uncharted lands and their people. She expressed her full support and offered her friendship! Who would have known such a small ambition of ours have given us an powerful and prestigious friend!?" 
 flavor_lil.4.a: "So our new Spring begins.."
 flavor_lil.4.t: "Vampire Slain!"
 flavor_lil.4.desc: "At last, after a long and bloody struggle,Our biggest threat lies broken and weak! Now we can finally focus on other matters without fangs looming over our necks.

 flavor_lil.5.t: "The Treaty of Misty Coast"
 flavor_lil.5.desc: "After the joint war against the Scarlet realm -which left it in shambles- Chireiden presented an offer to Jasmin Path: Chireiden offered their eternal support and friendship in turn of handing a good chunk of the scarlet land to them. And at the same time, we both relinquish any hopes or dreams of conquest towards said lands. The treaty's purpose is to keep the scarlets weakened and immobile. In practice, it still is! However, for us to accept these terms would see Chireiden's hold on the region strengthened! We should think carefully before making such decision."
 flavor_lil.5.a: "We accept the proposal!"

But this time she wasn't all formal as before. Rather, she was all excited and filled with glee! She mentions how she appreciates our mistress's investure in her capital, and asked us to become full partners. As in a 'Union'! She expressed her loyalty towards our trading policies and wished to be part of it. This was ultimately surprising! For the embellished sovereign of -not only a state- but a species, to offer an oath of partnership. We should approach this carefully; wouldn't want to keep our esteemed visitor waiting"
 flavor_lwe.3.a: "I hereby herald you spring.. The spring of death!"
 flavor_lwe.3.t: "The Fall of Chireiden"
 flavor_lwe.3.d: "Chireiden, and the court of satori has seen their last spring. After the -doomed to fail- treaty of misty coast, Lily, in a twist of fate, have turned her eyes westward; towards the heartlands of the underworld. And at the center of it, stands the city of Chireiden! It's said the sacking took days to finish, with fairy and mercenary troops alike pillaging everything that's valuabe from the jewel of the underworld. Some say the recent actions of lily's troops is reminiscent of the days of old; where tribalism took hold of fairy society! Wether this is true or not, one fact remains: Chireiden is no longer the jewel that it once was before Satori met Lily."
 flavor_lwe.7.a: "There will be no agony under my rule!"
 flavor_lwe.7.t: "Eternal Spring"
 flavor_lwe.7.d: "It's been a long road, and no matter what job lily had she performed it flawlessly! What started as a journey from a small flower field in gensokyo, Lily has risen to become one of the world's top figures not by authority and power alone, but beauty,kindness and loyalty. She has reached the height of her career, but still,the road never ends. And it's entirely up to her now how she continues ruling her empire."

 flavor_lwe.8.t: "A Fairy's Atlas"
