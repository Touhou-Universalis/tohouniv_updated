 flavor_fom.5.desc: "Our marketing strategy did not take long to get us the attention of several mages of Gensokyo. The most surprising one however is Patchouli herself, who has decided to leave the library for once and to check out what is going on here. When she realized, that Marisa and Alice were fond of Patchouli's rather random idea of a school for magic, she decided to join us as an advisor for our mistresses and as the librarian for the academy!"

Marisa has heard it often that the visual similarities between her and Ellen are quite obvious. However, the personalities are clearly different.\nEllen is quite childish and spontanous.\nStill, when it comes to business she beats Marisa as she has announced that her new home, the place which we used to call part of the Youkai Trail, will also become her second shop in Gensokyo.... or rather her cat's shop as she will be busy with teaching young witches and magicians about the Art of the Merchant."
 flavor_fom.6.a: "She is quite the ... special ... witch."

 HKR_genji_the_turtle_desc: "Despite his age and his ... turtle being ... Genjii is a powerful defender of the Shrine and served Reimu as a flying device before she learnt to fly on her own. Because of that service, Genjii suffers heavy back pain and is currently basically useless. He needs some healing before he can help us out yet again.\nFortunately, there is a healing ingredient in the Spring Path. If we get on good terms with its owner we might heal Genjii from his severe back pain."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_title: "Goddess of Poverty"
 HKR_harness_shions_power_desc: "There are many gods in Gensokyo, but none is as costly to house as Shion Yorigami, the goddess of poverty. And because of her powers she causes a lot of bad luck to all the people around her... except for Tenshi. While Reimu often played with the idea of banishing her from the Shrine, Heavenly Realm will not take her either.\nLuckily Reimu had an idea: harnassing the power of Shion in the Shrine's favor. And to test the weaponized poverty out we should unleash her misfortune on one of our rivals."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_tt: "A §Yrandom rival nation§!, who has been insulted and spied by us, will §Ysuffer a massive financial hit§!. (Is a lot less effective against rival players.)"
 HKR_please_aunn_title: "A Gift for Aunn"
 HKR_please_aunn_desc: "Aunn Komano is the secret guardian of all devine places - especially the Hakurei Shrine. Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstandment she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn. Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_title: "Study the Origins"
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo. Our shrine maiden Reimu has no problems to remember, but even then she needs a person of history and religion to remind her to meditate about the past and to reflect."
 HKR_touhou_2_title: "Marsh on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just marsh into Reimaden ourself and take the orbs from Mima."
 HKR_touhou_3_title: "The Okazaki Reform"
 HKR_touhou_3_desc: "Back in the days when our realm was still in the North, we had contact with people, who claim to be from the future. Their leader is a Professor called Yumemi Okazaki. Despite the issues she has caused for Reimu, the technology and the ideas of stress management helped her significantly.\nBut times have changed and with that the memories of Okazaki's reforms. We should try to get in contact with the Probability Space Hypervessel again."
 HKR_touhou_4_title: "Re-Acquire the Dream Lotus"
 HKR_touhou_4_desc: "Reimu collected special dream items during the Lotus Land Story Incident, which she later used to defeat Yuuka. Although Reimu has lost this artifact it is lost in time. All we have to do is convincing Yuuka to give it back to Reimu..."

 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_title: "[Root.GetName] and the Estates"
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_desc: "Usually, the goal of an absolute ruler is to control all of the crownland for themselves and being the head for all decisions of the state. But these are not usual times here in Gensokyo. Due to the curse of the Donation Box collecting of donations has proven pointless anyway. So instead we should focus on earning some money by selling the crownland."
 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_tt: "If we decide to sell crown land to the estates we will get '§YRevoked Donations§!' for §Y40 years§!, giving the following effects:\nMonthly Autonomy Change: §G-0.40§!\nLiberty Desire from Subjects Development: §G-150.0%§!\nProduction Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\n\nOtherwise we will get '§YDonations for the Estates§!' for §Y40 years§!, giving the following effects:\nNational Tax Modifier: §G+20.0%§!\nShrine Maidens Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\nYoukais Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!\nMerchant Guilds Loyalty Equilibrium: §G+10.0%§!"
 HKR_build_connections_title: "Build Connections"
 HKR_build_connections_desc: "It is no secret that our realm is not particularily in a good financial spot. Donations are vanishing, economical position is weak and we are surrounded by potential enemies meaning there is hardly an expansion opportunity for more money. To solve this issue we need to focus on alternative sources of income. We should build some connections with the local shrine maidens. Maybe they know of some jobs for us."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_title: "Youkai Exterminator"
 HKR_youkai_hunter_desc: "Our shrine maidens have reported that some youkais were going mad lately near Human Capital. Usually Byakuren or Keine would take care of them, but they have been busy too lately, so the job is now ours to do. But at least we got a good payment promised from the humans."
 HKR_youkai_hunter_tt: "Either own the provinces §YHuman Capital§!, §YLingering Snow Road§! and §YWest Bamboo Forest§! or exterminated mindless youkais for their province owners with the '§YExterminate Wild Youkais§!' diplomatic action."

 HKR_explore_east_pacific_desc: "The Barrier is lost and it is uncertain if we will ever manage to restore it to protect Gensokyo. However, we shouldn't grief about the lost and instead try to make the best out of it. Rumors tell that in the far east there might be some valuable gold and silver sources - and pure gold and silver do not vanish like donations. We should explore the sea beyond."
 HKR_explore_east_pacific_tt: "Discover §YEastern Polynesia§!."
 HKR_colonize_south_america_title: "Settle in the Andes"
 HKR_colonize_south_america_desc: "Apparently the rumors are true: there IS land in the far east! We should settle there and see if the stories about gold and silver are true though."
 HKR_incas_gold_title: "Wealth of the Incas"
 HKR_incas_gold_desc: "The new land in the east is filled with exotic food, new animals and strange youkais. But most noteworthy are the gold and silver sources. There is even a whole mountain filled with silver, which resources are are ready to be exploited for the donation box! All we need to do is taking it!"

 flavor_hkr.9.desc: "Usually it is a good sign when a god visits the throne of a country. But not today! [Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury. When the Shion incident happened, the guard noticed where our precious gold went and collected it all for our realm. Because of that he gets a gift of 10 Ducats."
 flavor_hkr.25.t: "Part 0: Origin of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hkr.25.desc: "A long time ago youkais and humans lived side by side on the normal world in a symbiotic relationship as Youkais nourish on the human emotions and faith while the humans profit from the youkai by using their powers for humankind. However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkais. However, the youkais needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."
 flavor_hkr.25.a: "Yeah ok, nice origin story for the continent, but what about the Hakurei Clan?"
 flavor_hkr.26.t: "Part 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers"
 flavor_hkr.26.desc: "Originally, our country has been a clan of shrine maidens and guardians from Japan. A role, which we now fulfill in Gensokyo today too. But our current position in Gensokyo wasn't always our home. Before that we lived in the high north of Gensokyo until the early incidents, which were investigated by Reimu Hakurei.\n\nThe first incident was about about the sudden destruction of the Hakurei Shrine, the heart of our realm. The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell. After several bloody battles and the first encounter with Mima, Reimu managed to defeat Konngara with the power of the unstable Yin-Yang Orbs. Not much is known about this incident later on though and only Konngara and Mima might know more from it."

 flavor_hkr.26.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Konngara and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."

 flavor_hkr.261.desc: "A girl in red samurai clothes with a fine katana and a long horn on her forehead - this is the visual memory Reimu has of Konngara, the Astral Knight. Nowadays, Konngara is enjoying a calm life in the remains of Hell's oldest location, the Silent Temple. However, back then she was the culprit of the first destruction of the Old Hakurei Shrine and got confronted by Reimu."

But this only remained for a short duration as one day the shrine was invaded by hellish monsters of unknown origin. As exterminating these monsters did not stop them from returning, Reimu decided to visit the Old Hell again. During her journey she encountered and defeated the Engineer Rika and the the Samurai Meira.\n\nWhen Reimu entered the realm of Reimaden a young witch tried to stop her. It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw eachother as enemies and could not stand eachother. However, after Marisa's and Mima's unavoidable defeat, Marisa decided to leave Reimaden to discover the wonders of Gensokyo on her own..."

 flavor_hkr.271.desc: "No ghost is as infamous as Mima is within Gensokyo. There have been rumors that she will come back and that her return will mean the end of Gensokyo. Reimu remembers the chaos that Mima has caused back in the days with her summoning of hellish creatures within the Hakurei Shrine - and Reimu had enough of that. When she confronted Mima in Reimaden it came to an epic battle between these two."
 flavor_hkr.271.a: "Good griefs... I don't want to think back to her Twilight Spark..."

As rumors of wishfulfilling being have reached the rest of Gensokyan many people traveled to the Fantasy Ruins to harness the power for themselves. But the ruins were quite small and only one person could get a wish. Naturally, a big battle royale happened and everyone fought against everybody. One of those persons was Marisa again and while these two were enemies on battle they started to have sympathy to eachother."

Although they are a mystery for the usual Gensokyan, Reimu can remember when Yumemi Okazaki, the leader of the Time Travelers, crashed into the Back Mountain. In order to hide themselves, they disguised their \"ship\" as ruins. However, Yumemi's assistant, Chiyuri, had to spread a rumor of a genie in the Fantasy Ruins, which eventually lead to Reimu facing off Yumemi."

When Reimu tried to finally relax the Hakurei Shrine got invaded by dozens and dozens of youkais. She and her former enemy and now good friend Marisa were more than annoyed by the sheer influx of new youkais. They went out to seal the source of these new youkais, which led them eventually to Mugenkan, the mansion of Yuuka Kazami. She revealed that she scared all the youkais off from her realm to finally enjoy more peace."

 flavor_hkr.30.desc: "Only 12 hours later after the \"Lotus Land Story\" Incident the shrine was yet again invaded, this time by demons from the neighbouring realm Makai. Reimu Hakurei was exhausted, but she could not let these demons stay in Gensokyo. So the young shrine maiden traveled to Makai, followed by Marisa, Mima and Yuuka. On her journey she saw how powerful demons surpressed youkais and how danmakus are used against inobedient fairies. After many fights, which almost ended lethally for Reimu, she managed to confront Shinki in Pandæmonium and defeated her barely..."

 flavor_hkr.301.desc: "The Goddess of Creation, the Mistress of Makai and Mother of Alice Margatroid. There might be more titles, but Shinki always uses these three. Nobody in Gensokyo was as difficult and dangerous to defeat for Reimu than Shinki - especially since there was no security during a Danmaku Duel back then. The fight against Shinki was one to life and death for herself. One she luckily won."

 flavor_hkr.31.desc: "Reimu returned after her final battle against Shinki to the Old Hakurei Shrine - or that what was remaining of it. Our old realm, her home, has been completely destroyed. All what is left are the foundations of the shrine and the donation box. After minutes which felt like hours of grief, the silence has been broken by the arrival of a person. She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkais and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her. She led the survivors of our people to the South of Gensokyo to rebuild the Clan and the Shrine there."
 flavor_hkr.31.a: "What happens next?"
 flavor_hkr.32.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.32.desc: "In the mean time a new power has entered Gensokyo's stage: Scarlet Realm, led by the vampire Remilia Scarlet. Remilia brought spells and powers from the far west, which were exceeding anything before in raw spell power. After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."
 flavor_hkr.32.a: "Go on."
 flavor_hkr.33.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.33.desc: "Reimu then trained several new shrine maidens in the teachings of youkai extermination, danmaku battles and the new Spell Card System. She managed to convert many people - be it youkais or humans - to Hakurei Shintoism, teaching them to stick to the Spell Card rules. It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has beed spreaded from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of shintoism and fighting. This movement later became the \"Hakurei Tradition\"."

 flavor_hkr.34.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.34.desc: "While all that was happening, Marisa Kirisame decided to move away too. During her journey in Makai she found a new colleague: Alice Margatroid. Despite their differences and conflicts they became good friends. They turned their back to North Gensokyo when they heard about Reimu and her implementing the Spell Card System in Gensokyo and decided to settle in the Forest of Magic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mima tried to become a god on her own, but got bored eventually and returned to Reimaden. It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."
