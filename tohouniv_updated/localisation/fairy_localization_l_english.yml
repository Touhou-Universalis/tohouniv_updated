The most surprising one however is Patchouli herself, who has decided to leave the library for once and to check out what is going on here.

However, the personalities are clearly different.\nEllen is quite childish and spontanous.\nStill, when it comes to business she beats Marisa as she has announced that her new home, the place which we used to call part of the Youkai Trail, will also become her second shop in Gensokyo.... or rather her cat's shop as she will be busy with teaching young witches and magicians about the Art of the Merchant."

 HKR_genji_the_turtle_desc: "Despite his age and his ... turtle being ... Genjii is a powerful defender of the Shrine and served Reimu as a flying device before she learnt to fly on her own. Because of that service, Genjii suffers heavy back pain and is currently basically useless. He needs some healing before he can help us out yet again.\nFortunately, the Aki Sisters in the Shrine of Harvest have some helpful ingredients for the healing. If we get on good terms with its owner we might heal Genjii from his severe back pain."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_title: "Goddess of Poverty"
 HKR_harness_shions_power_desc: "There are many gods in Gensokyo, but none is as costly to house as Shion Yorigami, the goddess of poverty. And because of her powers she causes a lot of bad luck to all the people around her... except for Tenshi. While Reimu often played with the idea of banishing her from the Shrine, Heavenly Realm will not take her either.\nLuckily Reimu had an idea: harnassing the power of Shion in the Shrine's favor. And to test the weaponized poverty out we should unleash her misfortune on one of our rivals."
 HKR_harness_shions_power_tt: "A §Yrandom rival nation§!, who has been insulted and spied by us, will §Ysuffer a massive financial hit§!. (Is a lot less effective against rival players.)"
 HKR_please_aunn_title: "A Gift for Aunn"
 HKR_please_aunn_desc: "Aunn Komano is the secret guardian of all devine places - especially the Hakurei Shrine. Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstandment she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn. Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_title: "Study the Origins"
 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo. Our shrine maiden Reimu has no problems to remember, but even then she needs a person of history and religion to remind her to meditate about the past and to reflect."
 HKR_touhou_2_title: "Marsh on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just marsh into Reimaden ourself and take the orbs from Mima."
 HKR_touhou_3_title: "The Okazaki Reform"
 HKR_touhou_3_desc: "Back in the days when our realm was still in the North, we had contact with people, who claim to be from the future. Their leader is a Professor called Yumemi Okazaki.

 HKR_sell_land_to_the_estates_desc: "Usually, the goal of an absolute ruler is to control all of the crownland for themselves and being the head for all decisions of the state.

 flavor_hkr.8.desc: "It was not easy but after some convining, Reimu managed to send Shion to our rival to pay them a little visit. Just how our Shrine Maiden expected, Shion's precense caused for a massive financial crisis in there!\nHowever, Shion noted that she prefers to not be used like that in the future and wants to help us by making loan sharks go bankrupt instead."
 flavor_hkr.8.a: "Don't forget the normal bank neither, Shion."
 flavor_hkr.9.t: "Shion's Visit"
 flavor_hkr.9.desc: "Usually it is a good sign when a god visits the throne of a country. But not today! [Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury. When the Shion incident happened, the guard noticed where our precious gold went and collected it all for our realm. Because of that he gets a gift of 10 Ducats."
 flavor_hkr.25.t: "Part 0: Origin of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hkr.25.desc: "A long time ago youkais and humans lived side by side on the normal world in a symbiotic relationship as Youkais nourish on the human emotions and faith while the humans profit from the youkai by using their powers for humankind. However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkais. However, the youkais needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."
 flavor_hkr.25.a: "Yeah ok, nice origin story for the continent, but what about the Hakurei Clan?"
 flavor_hkr.26.t: "Part 1: Highly Responsive to Prayers"
 flavor_hkr.26.desc: "Originally, our country has been a clan of shrine maidens and guardians from Japan. A role, which we now fulfill in Gensokyo today too. But our current position in Gensokyo wasn't always our home. Before that we lived in the high north of Gensokyo until the early incidents, which were investigated by Reimu Hakurei.\n\nThe first incident was about about the sudden destruction of the Hakurei Shrine, the heart of our realm. The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell. After several bloody battles and the first encounter with Mima, Reimu managed to defeat Konngara with the power of the unstable Yin-Yang Orbs. Not much is known about this incident later on though and only Konngara and Mima might know more from it."
 flavor_hkr.26.a: "These were weird times."
 flavor_hkr.26.a.tt: "Reimu can §Yrelive§! the memories of her Danmaku Fight against Konngara and face her again in a Danmaku Duel.\nShould she defeat her enemy in her memories she will remember some hidden §Ygold caches§! within the Old Hakurei Shrine and will collect them."

 flavor_hkr.261.desc: "A girl in red samurai clothes with a fine katana and a long horn on her forehead - this is the visual memory Reimu has of Konngara, the Astral Knight. Nowadays, Konngara is enjoying a calm life in the remains of Hell's oldest location, the Silent Temple. However, back then she was the culprit of the first destruction of the Old Hakurei Shrine and got confronted by Reimu."
 flavor_hkr.261.a: "I remember she didn't say a single word..."

 flavor_hkr.27.desc: "After the events of the \"High Responsive Prayer\" Incident the shrine enjoyed some time of peace. But this only remained for a short duration as one day the shrine was invaded by hellish monsters of unknown origin. As exterminating these monsters did not stop them from returning, Reimu decided to visit the Old Hell again. During her journey she encountered and defeated the Engineer Rika and the the Samurai Meira.\n\nWhen Reimu entered the realm of Reimaden a young witch tried to stop her. It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw eachother as enemies and could not stand eachother. However, after Marisa's and Mima's unavoidable defeat, Marisa decided to leave Reimaden to discover the wonders of Gensokyo on her own..."

 flavor_hkr.271.t: "Memory of Mima, the Evil Spirit"
 flavor_hkr.271.desc: "No ghost is as infamous as Mima is within Gensokyo. There have been rumors that she will come back and that her return will mean the end of Gensokyo. Reimu remembers the chaos that Mima has caused back in the days with her summoning of hellish creatures within the Hakurei Shrine - and Reimu had enough of that. When she confronted Mima in Reimaden it came to an epic battle between these two."
 flavor_hkr.271.a: "Good griefs... I don't want to think back to her Twilight Spark..."

As rumors of wishfulfilling being have reached the rest of Gensokyan many people traveled to the Fantasy Ruins to harness the power for themselves. But the ruins were quite small and only one person could get a wish. Naturally, a big battle royale happened and everyone fought against everybody. One of those persons was Marisa again and while these two were enemies on battle they started to have sympathy to eachother."

 flavor_hkr.281.desc: "Not much is known about the ones, who call themselves \"Time Traveler\" other than that they do their name justice. Although they are a mystery for the usual Gensokyan, Reimu can remember when Yumemi Okazaki, the leader of the Time Travelers, crashed into the Back Mountain. In order to hide themselves, they disguised their \"ship\" as ruins. However, Yumemi's assistant, Chiyuri, had to spread a rumor of a genie in the Fantasy Ruins, which eventually lead to Reimu facing off Yumemi."
 flavor_hkr.281.a: "Ah yes. I won my own personal maid on this day."

 flavor_hkr.29.desc: "The Northern Lands were like cursed as our realm had to go through three incidents in quick succession and the fourth did not let wait for it. When Reimu tried to finally relax the Hakurei Shrine got invaded by dozens and dozens of youkais. She and her former enemy and now good friend Marisa were more than annoyed by the sheer influx of new youkais. They went out to seal the source of these new youkais, which led them eventually to Mugenkan, the mansion of Yuuka Kazami. She revealed that she scared all the youkais off from her realm to finally enjoy more peace."

 flavor_hkr.30.t: "Part 5: Mystic Square"
 flavor_hkr.30.desc: "Only 12 hours later after the \"Lotus Land Story\" Incident the shrine was yet again invaded, this time by demons from the neighbouring realm Makai. Reimu Hakurei was exhausted, but she could not let these demons stay in Gensokyo. So the young shrine maiden traveled to Makai, followed by Marisa, Mima and Yuuka. On her journey she saw how powerful demons surpressed youkais and how danmakus are used against inobedient fairies. After many fights, which almost ended lethally for Reimu, she managed to confront Shinki in Pandæmonium and defeated her barely..."

 flavor_hkr.301.desc: "The Goddess of Creation, the Mistress of Makai and Mother of Alice Margatroid. There might be more titles, but Shinki always uses these three. Nobody in Gensokyo was as difficult and dangerous to defeat for Reimu than Shinki - especially since there was no security during a Danmaku Duel back then. The fight against Shinki was one to life and death for herself. One she luckily won."
 flavor_hkr.301.a: "Fortunately, Shinki is a nowadays a lot calmer."
 flavor_hkr.301.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger the memory of a fight between the Shinki and Reimu!§!"
 flavor_hkr.31.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.31.desc: "Reimu returned after her final battle against Shinki to the Old Hakurei Shrine - or that what was remaining of it. Our old realm, her home, has been completely destroyed. All what is left are the foundations of the shrine and the donation box. After minutes which felt like hours of grief, the silence has been broken by the arrival of a person. She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkais and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her. She led the survivors of our people to the South of Gensokyo to rebuild the Clan and the Shrine there."
 flavor_hkr.31.a: "What happens next?"
 flavor_hkr.32.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.32.desc: "In the mean time a new power has entered Gensokyo's stage: Scarlet Realm, led by the vampire Remilia Scarlet. Remilia brought spells and powers from the far west, which were exceeding anything before in raw spell power. After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."
 flavor_hkr.32.a: "Go on."
 flavor_hkr.33.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.33.desc: "Reimu then trained several new shrine maidens in the teachings of youkai extermination, danmaku battles and the new Spell Card System. She managed to convert many people - be it youkais or humans - to Hakurei Shintoism, teaching them to stick to the Spell Card rules. It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has beed spreaded from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of shintoism and fighting. This movement later became the \"Hakurei Tradition\"."

 flavor_hkr.34.t: "Epilogue"
 flavor_hkr.34.desc: "While all that was happening, Marisa Kirisame decided to move away too. During her journey in Makai she found a new colleague: Alice Margatroid. Despite their differences and conflicts they became good friends. They turned their back to North Gensokyo when they heard about Reimu and her implementing the Spell Card System in Gensokyo and decided to settle in the Forest of Magic.\n\nMeanwhile, Mima tried to become a god on her own, but got bored eventually and returned to Reimaden. It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."

 ###EVEBTS FOR WINTER JASMINE PATH###
 flavor_lil.1.t: "A convenient Alliance"
 flavor_lil.1.desc: "Lily was the whole day busy. She learnt different ways of wording her plea, she memorized everything what Satori could appeal - yet the fear still sits deep in her. Satori has a notorious reputation of letting annoying fairies become the new servants of her hell cat pet...\nThe moment has come and Lily entered the secretive mansion \"Chireiden\"..."
 flavor_lil.1.a: "Ok, Lily, you can do it!"
 flavor_lil.1.a.tt: "Lily will meet Satori in Chireiden and tries to convince her for an alliance.\nIf our relations with Chireiden are well enough Satori might consider allying with us - but we will have to fulfil her expectations."
 flavor_lil.1.b: "On second thought... Satori is too scary..."
 flavor_lil.1.b.tt: "Lily will avoid Satori. As such, we will get no chance for an alliance with Chireiden, but we will not have any obligations to Satori."
 flavor_lil.2.t: "The Pleas of a Fairy"
 flavor_lil.2.desc: "Satori doesn't get visitors that regularly and when some then they are usually some incident investigators. Because of that, Satori was quite surprised when a simple-minded fairy - Lily White to be more precise - entered her mansion. The spring fairy stuttered and her fear was quite visible; she was unable to say a decent word. Luckily for her, our good mistress is a mindreader. After searching in Lily's minds, Satori learns that this weak fairy seeks Chireiden's support against Remilia Scarlet.\nWhile Lily is very unimpressive, her little home does actually have strategical potential. In case of a war with Scarlet Realm, Lily will us serve as a meat shield against Remilia's forces and maybe she will even become our vassal when feels safe enough again..."
 flavor_lil.2.a: "Hmmm... Orin mentioned that she could use more zombie fairies."
 flavor_lil.2.a.tt: "We will support Lily in her strive to fight against Remilia. In return we will be able to demand her absolute obedience when Remilia has been neutralized."

 flavor_lil.4.t: "Satori declines the Alliance"
 flavor_lil.4.desc: "Despite Lily's best attempts, Satori was not convinced by our beloved ruler. She called Lily as \"replaceable\" and \"useless\" and sent her packing! Even though we lack the power now, we will not forget this insult and will repay it to her!"
 flavor_lil.4.a: "She is so mean..."
 flavor_lil.5.t: "Komeiji's Demand"
 flavor_lil.5.desc: "It has been done! The Scarlet Devil has been defeated and her mansion has been liberated from the vampires! The many fairy maidens joined now our cause while of the residents every sign has been missing.\nWhile these are great news for Lily, they also mean something more worrisome: our good fairy lady made a pact with Satori Komeiji for the safety of [Root.GetNmae]. In return, the fairies of [Root.GetName] serve Satori in her campaign shall the Scarlet Devil be eliminated - and now Satori reminds Lily of this pact quite drastically.\nLily now has to decide if she wants our realm to submit to the satori or if she wants us to deny this pact and risk a war against Chireiden..."

 flavor_lil.8.t: "The Corruption of Saigyou Ayakashi"
 flavor_lil.8.desc: "While the safed spring power of the tree enhanced Lily, a darkness has been growing in our beloved Mistress! Saigyou Ayakashi is resisting and so collected all the negative emotions our mistress had in her life. In a moment of unwariness, the dark energy got unleashed and a new persona has risen out of Lily: a doppelganger of her, but in complete black and with a look of decay in her eyes!"
 flavor_lil.8.a: "We have to stop her before she spreads the corruption!"
 LIL_enable_lily_black_fight: "Enable the Danmaku Fight against Lily Black!"
 flavor_lil.9.t: "Lily Black, the Evil Side of Lily"
 flavor_lil.9.desc: "Unlike any other fairy, Lily Black has a unnatural aura; one, which completely negates the beauty of spring and let even the prettiest flowers rot. She is a fairy, but not one of nature but one of the demon tree Saigyou. If she is left unchecked, the fairies of Gensokyo might end up being absorbed and their life essences being used for the demon tree! [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to face her and defeat this agent of corruptness!"
 flavor_lil.9.a: "Now or never! For [Root.GetName]!"

 flavor_lil.11.a.tt: "You can encounter Lily Black §Y5 Years§! later again."
 flavor_lil.12.t: "Sealing of Saigyou Ayakashi"
 flavor_lil.12.desc: "With the defeat of Lily Black, life has begun to bloom next to the Demon Tree again! Although the tree will always remain a threat in Gensokyo and the evil within is not destroyable, we at least managed to seal it away. However, the remaining spring energy of the tree has been freed! Now it is up to Lily to harness it and bring harmony and prosperity to our realm!"
 flavor_lil.12.a: "It will be a pleasure!"
 flavor_lil.13.t: "Eternal Spring"
 flavor_lil.13.desc: "It is done! Lily managed to harness the Spring Power from the evil demon tree and used it to bring prosperity to our people in Gensokyo! We have ensured that nobody will ever again try to steal Spring and let the world stay in eternal ice and darkness and used its power to do good things! Now Lily can focus on her actual duty which is letting people know that the best season of the year has come!"

More to it in the \"Rules\".\n\nReward: the winner of this Challenge will earn the most beautiful crown made by Fairies as well as the undying loyalty of all fairies in Gensokyo.\n\nRules: every participant will get every 3 years a set of challenges against randomly chosen bakas. Goal is to finish as many challenges of the five as possible. A finished challenge gives points depending on the difficulty. At the beginning of the next cycle, all currently taken challenges will expire and you get a new set. The Royal Fairy Challenge lasts for 36 years. The challenger with the most points will win!\n- Diplomacy: sending an insult to a baka gives 1 point.\n- Warfare: being at a winning war (their warscore < -50%) with the baka gives 3 points.\n- Royalty: having a royal manage with the baka or subjugating the baka gives 3 points.\n- Danmaku Duels: a duel against the baka gives 5 points.\n- Pranks: for a prank played against a baka you get 3 points.\n\nThen the results has to be shown to Daiyousei for judgement with a decision."

 th_education_events.2.fairy.desc: "It is common for a fairy ruler to train to maintain the status of the Strongest.

 th_education_events.4.fairy.desc: "Fairies aren't really good talkers. They prefer to do stuff instead. But in a world where everyone can declare you a war because your words were misunderstood as insults it is better to have someone who can speak for the fairies. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to fulfil this role, but unfortunately [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] isn't the most skilled diplomat. To change this our ruler has to speak with other rulers - even if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will embarrass [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]..."

 th_education_events.5.fairy.desc: "Wars aren't unknown for fairies. A lot of our people fought and died for their slave masters. But they were mostly used like mercenaries and never had a real training. [Root.Monarch.GetName] desires to change this and tries to make Cirinia's troops to a professional army. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacks the knowledge how to train, which means [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to experimentise with the many training methods..."
 th_education_events.5.a: "Well, let the soldiers fight against each other on top of a volcano to make them stronger!"

 th_education_events.100.desc: "While having special powers or being good at danmaku fights make it easier to maintain the position of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it doesn't ensure though that [Root.Monarch.GetName] can solve all issues a ruler has to face.
