Zeus was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods on Olympus.\n\n With our Weather Control abilities, and Celestial heritage, Tenshi and Iku can easily pretend to be Zeus relatives, gaining the trust of Greeks as their new goddesses.\n\nBy showing the Greeks our real power against Ottomans, we forced them to rebel against their opressors, claiming their loyalty to us, as their new gods."

Not only that, now, Tenshi knows how to change the flows of the rivers, and to use to our advantage.\n\nBut there is one more thing that Tenshi learned from Suwako, quite simple and effective way to use earth as a weapon.

We can receive her protection, but we will lose our independence, so that might be a bad choice. Or, we can offer to sell our cannon technologies for a hefty price, while maintaining friendly relations with Tenshi, but, we are not sure if she will accept this counter-offer.

 flavor_hvr.19.desc: "In old Slavic culture, the gods and spirits were polarized, representing opposites, such as darkness and light, masculine and feminine.\n\nFor Slavic people, the highest god of the pantheon was Perun, the god of sky, thunder, lightning, storms, rain, law, war, fertility and oak trees. With Iku abilities to control thunder, lightning, storm and rain, it will be quite easy to represent her as the descendant of the Perun, gaining the trust of the Slavic people, and converting them to the old faith!\n\nMat Zemlya, meaning Mother Earth, was being the oldest deity in old Slavic religion, and one of the most important one too. The earth, according to the common Slavic tradition, is a symbol of motherhood and femininity. She is the universal Mother and nurse: she nourishes the living, and accepts the dead. With Tenshi ability to control and manipulate Earth, she is more than ready to prove herself to be a Mother Earth for the Slavic people, returning their faith to the old ways. Even before becoming a celestial, Tenshi first name was Chiko, which means Earth Child. Who knows, perhaps Tenshi was always connected to Mother Earth, being her descendant.\n\nIn riddles and old sayings, archaic ideas about sky (Perun) and earth (Mother Earth) as a married couple have been preserved. With both Iku representing Perun, and Tenshi representing Mother Earth, we will surely gain trust of Slavic people!"

The rumors says, that the Judgement day is here, and the only way to find the salvation - is to accept Tenshi as our saviour. Some, on other hand, believe that Angel, Tenshi, is here not to save us, but to proclaim the beginning of the end of the world!\n\nEither way we can certainly use that against them! Let them think that the Judgement day is upon them, and that only Tenshi can save them! So, abandom your old faith, and accept Tenshi as your sole Saviour in the apocalypce ahead! And for those that still doubt Tenshi... there is a few meteorites that can accidently fall into your country!"

Tenshi gave Yukari a good beating that Yukari would not forget for a long time. Perhaps Yukari will have to rest... for 20 or 30 years.\n\nNot only that, Tenshi, and our country in particular, has received a lot of prestige for beating up one of the strongest beings of Gensokyo, sage Yukari Yakumo herself. Perhaps, other countries will even turn a blind eye if we conquer their neighbors."

 flavor_hvr.23.desc: "According to the ancient belief of the peoples of Scandinavia, people are filled with a divine essence that is outside of consciousness. This divine essence is expressed through gods and goddesses. The gods are relatives of people, it is customary to honor and praise the gods. The most notable god in the old Norse religion was the supreme god of the pantheon, who is revered the most, Odin. Thor, son of Odin, is the lord of storms and the guardian of the world of people, was also very famous and respected. Other gods such as Freyja, Loki, Yggdrasil, Tyr, Njord were also fairly known and respected.\n\nThe interesting fact about the Norse gods, is that they were eating miraculous rejuvenating apples, that allowed them to remain immortal and gave them strength. It almost sounds like our Heavenly Peaches - a special kind of peaches growing in heaven, which allows anyone eating them, to increase their strenght.\n\nWith excellent ability to control storms, hurricanes, and lightning, Iku can pass herself off as Odin's daughter quite easily. With abilities quite similar to Thor, son of Odin, she will claim herself to a daughter of Odin, which will help in submitting Scandivian people to us, and our faith.\n\nWith a great ability to destroy everything in her path, with her warlike spirit and hot temper, Tenshi can easily impersonate Brunhilde, the great Valkyrie, to lead the Scandinavian people into a war against our enemies!"

The climate here is harsh, but controlling these lands will allow us to create a transit point with Gensokyo, allowing us to more comfortably travel between Heavens, Gensokyo, and America.\n\nNow, in order to create settlements in Cascadia, we will need people and money.

We will build  a modern road that will connect most of our American states. This road will allow our troops to travel through whole America without issues, filled to the brim with supplies.

And now it is Tenshi responsobility to deal with them. We can deal with them in several ways.\n\nThe first way would finding a loophole in the contract, in the agreement that Tenshi made with the Oni. It might take some of our time, and our best minds will have to work on the solution. Then, we will also have to persuade them to leave our lands peacefully. Perhaps we will need to pay them with gold.\n\nThe second solution would be to just expel them with force. While Oni are really strong, so are we, Celestials. We might take some losses, but we will expel them for sure!\n\nAnd the third option, would be to offer a job for Oni. Oni is strong, and we could really use their forces as mercenaries. It will take some time to create a proper offer for Oni, that they will surely accept, and it will also require us to pay up a hefty sum of ducats to them in advance."

Even though most skirmishes end in victory for the Celestials, it still gets on our nerves, and now, even Tenshi felt it herself.\n\nSo let's solve this problem once and for all. Shinigamis that are being sent to Heaven, do not act of their own free will. No, they have a boss that makes them do it - Yama, the judge of the dead. Most likely, Eiki Shiki is behind these Shinigamis that continue to invade the Heavens, trying to take the lives of our Celestials, so it would be logical to deal with this Yama.\n\nWe can choose a different approaches in solving this problem. We can punch this Eiki in the face in such a way that it will discourage her from trying to poke her nose into Heaven ever again.

But despite this, after some time, we got down to business.\n\nArguing that we, the Celestials, are in fact one of the nicest persons in Gensokyo, that we do not interfere with anyone, we began to persuade Yama to stop sending Shinigamis after Celestials in the Heavens. And in order to finally convince Yama in the rightness of our words, we gave her a small, modest gift. 1000 ducats for Yama Eiki Shiki so she can take a break from her tiresome work!\n\nAfter we gave Yama a small gift, her attitude towards us immediately changed. She agreed that the Celestials were generally good people. After all, only good people can have so much gold. On this, we decided and agreed with Yama that she would not send Shinigami to heaven."

Tenshi personally gave a bribe to the judge, and she gladly accepted it!\n\nWhat is this Eiki Shiki doing with all this money she gets from bribes? We had to do a thorough investigation to find out, and we found what we were looking for! The luxurious mansion on the shores of Gulf of Gensokyo belongs to our dear judge! Golden decoration of the premises, a separate bar, a lounge, a ballroom, and much, much more were found in this mansion.

 HVR_way_to_use_keystones_desc: "Keystones... We can control them, but we didn't find much use of them, other than throwing them at enemies... until now! With the development of our army and fleet, Tenshi have noticed that we can use keystones in quite unusual and useful way.\n\nBy attaching these Keystones to our ships, and controlling them, we can boost the speed of our ships to absolutely new levels!\n\nNot only that, we can create a scout party that will float around on the keystones! They will be able to scout the area before engagement, and provide us with a value information about the shortest route available! We won't be able to create a scout party for every single unit of our army, but, we will manage to do so for our marines!"
 HVR_dancing_halls_title: "Dance Halls"
 HVR_dancing_halls_desc: "Our troops have already proven to be one of the best, always eager to battle and adventure. All thanks to Iku Nagae, who leads them into the battle, be it land, or sea. However, even the best troops tire up with time. And Iku Nagae, along with her marines brigade, is not exception.\n\nAs we know, Iku is quite interested in dancing. What if we will build a whole Dance Hall for her and her troops? Surely, Iku will be glad to receive such favor from us! Not to mention, it will improve troops morale too! By allowing them to rest from time to time, we will improve the quality of our troops in the long run."

 LCU_advanced_warfare_title: "Advanced Warfare"
 LCU_advanced_warfare_desc: "Using our own technologican researches, and the human technology we found on Yumemi's spaceship, we can create something special for our troops. An exoskeleton that will increase their mobility, their defenses, and that will also increase their overall strength. Weak rabbits will now be quite strong, thanks to our exoskeletons, which will allow us to equip them with breakthrough, heavy weapons. However, the manufacture of exoskeletons requires a lot of rare materials, and their production itself takes a long time. The maximum that we can afford is to equip one regiment of infantrymen with these elite weapons."

 HVR_stormbringer_title: "Stormbringers"
 HVR_stormbringer_desc: "The art of shipbuilding in Gensokyo and Asia is at a rather backward level. We need new ideas that will allow us to create a ship of a fundamentally new level! A ship that would allow us to carry out quick sea sorties. A ship that has the ability to stand up for itself, while having the ability to transport our marines. Perhaps people from Europe are much more skilled in this matter. We must visit these people, establish relations with them! Using our own ideas, and the ideas of Europe, we will be able to create a new ship for our needs."

 HVR_judgement_day_title: "Judgement Day"
 HVR_judgement_day_desc: "With our rapid conquest of Europe, Europeans are slowly getting worried. Rumors about the coming Judgement Day start to reach various European countries, as Tenshi is viewed as an Angel and messenger of the upcoming apocalypse. We should use that opportunity to scare Europeans even more! Perhaps, we will be able to convert them to our faith!"

 HVR_angel_of_apocalypse_desc: "With the faith in Christianity being in shambles, more and more people start to believe in Tenshi instead!

This way, we will be able to find some investors, those, that are willing to invest in the development of our Resort.\n\nNot only that, with our country increased popularity, we can try to attract foreign mining specialists, allowing us to mine gold more efficiently! As our Jewelry production only goes up lately, they will be pretty helpful for us."

 HVR_ties_with_moon_title: "Our Ties with Moon"
 HVR_ties_with_moon_desc: "Iku, being the messenger of Dragon Palace, regularly visits Lunar Capital. Even Tenshi has been here a few times. Our relations with Lunar Capital can be described as mutual neutrality. As Celestials are considered to be pure beings, Lunarians do not view us as enemies, but rather, as something close to distant acquaintance.\n\nBut recently, as Lunarians face a crisis in the face of Junko invasion, we can improve our relations, taking them to another level. We can help them deal with Junko, but in return, they will be forced to become our Junior partners. They might disagree with that offer, but we can always try. The other solution would be to just overtake them by force, while they are preoccupied with Junko."

 HVR_former_glory_of_lcu_desc: "With our control over the Moon, we still have some responsibilities to be fulfilled for Lunarians. As Lunarians has been taken over by us, as a Junior partner, they at least expect us to rule with just. Right now, their sole desire is to completely repel invaders from the Moon, and regain complete control over it, and we shall help them with that. With this action, we also expect to gain the trust of Lunarian princess, Yorihime Watatsuki. With her abilities and experience, we hope that she will become our trusted advisor from now on."

 HVR_dragon_god_title: "Control over Dragon God"
 HVR_dragon_god_desc: "Our second goal should be restoring Lunarian cities to their former glory. By building new architecture and restoring what has been damaged by the war, we expect to gain even more trust from the Lunarian princess. Yorihime Watatsuki, with her abilities to control and summon various gods, can become a valuable teacher for Iku. As Iku uses the abilities of the Dragon God to affect the weather, Yorihime can become a great mentor for her. And who knows, maybe Tenshi will also manage to learn something from Yorihime."

 HVR_weather_control_desc: "With practise, Tenshi and Iku will learn how to use Weather control abilities in new, unexpected ways!"

 HVR_learn_from_suwako_title: "Learn from Suwako"
 HVR_learn_from_suwako_desc: "Suwako, the true goddess of the Moriya Temple, has the ability to create and manipulate the earth. Such a skilled mentor would be very useful to Tenshi. Our Tenshi, who, although knows how to partially control the earth, lacks the ability to do that properly. We should appease the goddess of the Moriya Temple and ask her to teach Tenshi her skills a little!"

 HVR_mastery_over_nature_title: "Mastery over Nature"
 HVR_mastery_over_nature_desc: "With constant usage of Weather control, and with a few teachers that helped us, Tenshi and Iku will eventually master control over the Weather, finding even more ways to use it to our advantage!"

 HVR_space_ship_title: "Annoying Space Ship"
 HVR_space_ship_desc: "That annoying spaceship, flying around our Heavens... Objectives of this ship are quite unclear to us. The best solution would be to deal with this ship, once and for all! Perhaps we will also manage to obtain some kind of new technology by seizing it!"

 HVR_fake_hakurei_title: "Fake Hakurei"
 HVR_fake_hakurei_desc: "There is that weird person close to our borders, pretending to be Hakurei Miko. Tenshi is confused by this blasphemy. While Tenshi has quite bad relations with the real Hakurei Miko, at least fights with the real Miko are fun! This impostor on the other hand... We shall give her a test, by showing her the might of our army!"

 HVR_dont_deal_with_devil_title: "Don't deal with the Devil"

 HVR_make_paradise_out_of_hell_title: "Paradise in Hell"
 HVR_make_paradise_out_of_hell_desc: "While Makai is considered to be hell, it is in fact, hell only in name. Shinki did a good job when she was building Makai. You can find style and beauty in Makai architecture. However, it is still quite lacking, compared to Heaven.\n\nWe shall improve this place, which is now under our direct control, and make it even better! We should also not forget about defense, as mountains and miasma, filling some places of Makai, can be used to our advantage."

 HVR_trust_of_nobles_title: "Regained Trust of Nobles"
 HVR_trust_of_nobles_desc: "With the successful elimination of possible threat in the face of Makai, seizure of the Lunarian throne, and profitable deal with Kappapolis, Nobles estate started to completely trust Tenshi and her actions. Her actions make Heavens only stronger, and for that reason, Nobles are now ready to support Tenshi in any possible action."

 HVR_red_shrine_maiden_title: "Visiting Red Shrine Maiden"
 HVR_red_shrine_maiden_desc: "Relations between Reimu and Tenshi went downhill after Tenshi destroyed the Hakurei clan. As for Tenshi, there is also every reason to dislike Reimu. Reimu keeps Tenshi's dear friend, Shion Yorigami, literally in poverty. The stupid beggar priestess can't even feed her guests! Perhaps Tenshi's visit will help with resolving this issue."

 HVR_favor_for_a_friend_title: "Favor for a Friend"
 HVR_favor_for_a_friend_desc: "Seeing the awful conditions of living in Hakurei Shrine, Tenshi decided to take the situation under her control. By freeing Shion from Reimu, we will do a great favor for Tenshi's friend! Finally, Shion will no longer be starving!"

 HVR_engineers_of_kappapolis_title: "Engineers of Kappapolis"
 HVR_engineers_of_kappapolis_desc: "The guns that we have already received are certainly not bad. But the true masters of these weapons, the Kappas, should be our goal. Kappas experience and skill will allow us to craft much more powerful weapons. The only thing that remains is to gain the support of Kappa. We can gain it via diplomatic way, or, by using our force."

 HVR_overtune_of_cannons_title: "Overture of Cannons"
 HVR_overtune_of_cannons_desc: "The sound of our cannons... it's a whole symphony! Music, worthy of Tenshi's ears. The weapons received from Kappapolis will serve us faithfully and will instill fear in our enemies with their sound alone."

 HVR_trust_of_iku_nagae_title: "Gain Trust of Iku Nagae"
 HVR_trust_of_iku_nagae_desc: "Relations between Tenshi and Iku are far from perfect. At best, Iku views Tenshi as an annoying girl that bosses her around. Tenshi is at fault for this, due to her rude and prideful personality. We need to fix this gap between Tenshi and Iku, as Iku's help will be very useful for both the country and Tenshi.\n\nBy building a personal office for Iku, with a break room, Tenshi will show Iku that she appreciates her. Surely, it will improve relations between them."

 HVR_blood_and_thunder_title: "Blood and Thunder"
 HVR_blood_and_thunder_desc: "Theory is nothing without practice. We need to give our Marines real combat experience. For Iku, this will also become a great opportunity to face the real fight and will allow her to improve her skills as a commander on the battlefield, whether it would be sea or land combat.\n\nSplit your lungs with blood and thunder\nWhen you see the white whale\nBreak your backs and crack your oars, men\nIf you wish to prevail"

 HVR_gods_and_humans_title: "Gods and Humans"
 HVR_gods_and_humans_desc: "Now that we have our own representation in Europe, we can make an impact on people. People had many different pantheons of gods in antiquity, and at the same time, other religions were common. Now, most of the people of Europe have converted to the faith of Christianity, forgetting their old roots.\n\nWe can use it for our own purposes, thus gaining people's trust! We are the Celestials, and we have more than enough of unique abilities described in the myths of humans! Thunder and Lightning, Earth and Water - these elements are subject to us! So let's pretend to be ancient gods for these stupid people!"

 HVR_thunder_of_perun_title: "Thunder of Perun"
 HVR_thunder_of_perun_desc: "The ancient Slavs revered Perun and Mother Earth as their gods. We can play on this in order to win their trust. After all, for this, we have Iku and Tenshi.

 HVR_deal_with_clergy_desc: "The Clergy estate doesn't view Tenshi as a legitime ruler. They want to return back to peaceful times, and they are displeased by Tenshi ambitions.

 HVR_audence_with_miko_title: "Audience with Miko"
 HVR_audence_with_miko_desc: "To resolve our differences with the Clergy, getting a blessing from Toyosatomimi no Miko would be a good idea.

 HVR_doing_a_favor_for_miko_title: "Doing a Favor for Miko"
 HVR_doing_a_favor_for_miko_desc: "Looks like Miko indeed had quite a task for Tenshi. Her religious rival, Byakuren Hijiri, gives her a lot of trouble.\n\nThis is where Tenshi comes into play. For Tenshi, Miko has a special task. To visit Byakuren and show her the complete superiority of Taoism over Buddhism. Perhaps Byakuren would renounce his faith if we will give her a little... pressure. This will be a small favor for Tenshi, which Miko asks to perform.

Sometimes these Shinigamis succeed, sometimes, Celestials fight back. But it would be better to solve this problem once and for all. After all, Shinigamis don't come here of their own free will. Yama sends them here. So let's deal with this Yama. We shall pay Higan a visit!"

 HVR_deal_with_shinigami_title: "Deal with Shinigami"
 HVR_deal_with_shinigami_desc: "Well, it's time to deal with this Yama, once and for all. We can choose different methods of how to deal with her. We can bribe Eiki.

Different approaches will bring different results, but in any case, Yama and her annoying Shinigami will be finished!"

 HVR_resort_paradise_title: "Resort Paradise"
 HVR_resort_paradise_desc: "Tenshi had another rather interesting idea. Opening up an entertainment resort in Heaven! We will invite only the most powerful and wealthy guests from Gensokyo.

This will allow us to collect some good taxes from rich casino visitors. There is enough people of Gensokyo that will seek to visit our casino, for different reasons, be it desire to become rich quick, or just the gambling pleasure itself. What's more, our ruler, Tenshi, with her unnatural luck, will be able to beat any unfortunate casino visitor, getting a valuable catch for herself! The only problem, is that we don't have a proper equipment to set up the casino. Perhaps Yukari will be able to help us with that."
