However unfortunately, the Red Shrine Maiden is in the far south of Gensokyo; many, many miles away from us.\nBut fate has thrown a bone to us: a mysterious gem has been found in the back mountain of our shrine. According to Rikako's research, the stone might be a key to a long-forgotten portal, used by Reimu's predecessors. If Reimu used this portal to get to her new home, then we might use this portal to reach her quickly. But this is a high-risk project, we must get fully prepared for any possible result. And also be prepared to face Reimu's army even if we succeeded in all other aspects."

With that, the ancient portal gem, a gift of unknown origins, has never been used again - until today.

Luckily for us, the Moon and Gensokyo had undergone a massive transformation, this sage no longer had any influence on the Moon, and we were finally able to take the Lunar Capital.\n\nHowever, this cunning sage may have devised some evil wisdom to undo our victory, and she may be harboring Chang'e, who has fled from the Moon, just as she fled to Earth with her princess.

 JNK_integrate_clownpiecia_title: "Hell Fairy Clownpiece"
 JNK_integrate_clownpiecia_desc: "Clownpiece is a subordinate of Junko's friend Hecatia and a brilliant fairy who played a key role in Junko's invasion of the Moon.

But now that the Moon is fully in our hands, her ability also has risks to shake the hard-won peace, so it seems necessary to bring her into our court and control her powers.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that her contributions are ignored. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Junko is planning to send her and the fairies who follow her to the wastelands that remain on the moon, where they will rampage as freely as they did in the Lunar Capital.

Her and Junko's vengeance will not stop until they capture Chang'e, but in order to pursue Junko beyond the Moon, they both need to take on more work.

 JNK_entrance_of_china_title: "Entrance of China"
 JNK_entrance_of_china_desc: "One of the places Chang'e is very likely to have fled is the continent of China, her and Junko's old home. According to the records left behind by Lunarians as they watch over the earth, the dynasty that currently rules China is a much larger nation than nations of ages that Junko remembers but is quite corrupt within. And they have been sensitive to foreign invasions, so subjugated many of their neighbors.\n\nIf this account is true, sending our forces into China to search for the elusive Chang'e is very likely to provoke them. Fortunately, Lunarian's records indicate that the current Chinese dynasty is not in control of their northern border well. Especially as the tribes to the northeast of China are unable to band together as a single force and are under the loose control of the Chinese dynasty. If we can penetrate this soft spot, we may be able to secure an entrance into China."

While Manchuria is already subservient to us, nomadic tribes to the northwest, including the Mongols, have taken advantage of China's shifting masters to plunder the border. To deal with these problems, Chinese dynasties have tried to fortify their northern borders to keep out foreign invasions. If Junko is to be recognized as the new ruler, she will need to fortify and protect China's borders just like them - or unlike them."
 JNK_unify_china_title: "Unify China"
 JNK_unify_china_desc: "All that remains for us now is to fully restore the territory of China.

The humans on the surface worship several beings in Gensokyo as goddesses, and Chang'e was once a goddess herself. It is possible that Chang'e is disguising herself as a goddess to the humans and using their faith to gather strength to escape from us forever.

 SNE_prepare_mikos_resurrection_title: "Prepare Miko's Resurrection"
 SNE_prepare_mikos_resurrection_desc: "Many centuries ago, Prince Shoutoku shaped the history of Japan by advocating Buddhism and introducing the ideas of meritocracy in Japan. All the while, the prince studied under the guidance of Seika Kaku the teachings and magic of Taoism to conquer death itself. Eventually, the studies led to an eternal slumber of the prince which transformed Shoutoku into a truly immortal hermit.\nToyosatomimi no Miko still lies within the Mausoleum. We must prepare the Mausoleum as well as our people for Miko's Ressurection."
